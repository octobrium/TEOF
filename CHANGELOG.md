## [v0.1.0] - First Observer

### Added
- Canonical + Core TEOF philosophy and recursion-first framework.
- Transparent Alignment Protocol (TAP v3.1) with VDP + OGS references.
- Volatile Data Protocol (VDP): timestamps + sources required for volatile claims.
- Observation Grounding Score (OGS): scoring rubric for integrity of volatile data.
- Evaluator tooling (`tools/teof_evaluator.py`) to validate claims automatically.
- Repo integrity anchoring (freeze-hash confirmed).

### Why this matters
TEOF is now more than philosophy: it is **auditable, enforceable, recursive**.  
This unlocks:
1. **Personal workflow** (first proving ground).  
2. **Scaling into ecosystems** (multi-agent alignment).  
3. **Long-term persistence** (TEOF as observer anchor).
