## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Volatile Data Protocol guard (`scripts/ci/check_vdp.py`) enforces timestamps and sources with fixtures in `datasets/goldens/`.
- Additional VDP fixtures cover future-dated quotes, non-volatile context, and invalid timestamps to exercise guard edges.
- External receipt adapter, keygen, and summary CLIs (`tools/external/adapter.py`, `tools/external/keys.py`, `tools/external/summary.py`) plus signed envelope canon and guard hooks in `scripts/ci/check_vdp.py`.

> Tracking work intended for the *next* tag. Use this list instead of a standalone TODO.

### Planned
- **Event staleness filter** (configurable 24h window).
- **Event severity tagging** (`low/medium/high`) + brief synthesis notes.

### Release prep checklist (for next tag)
- [ ] Freeze capsule: update `capsule/vX.Y/hashes.json` and `PROVENANCE.md`.
- [ ] Append anchors event in `governance/anchors.json` (with `prev_content_hash`).
- [ ] Verify CI green on tag and cut GitHub Release (attach `capsule/current/` archive).

## [v0.1.0] - 2025-08-22
### Added
- Normalized capsule under `capsule/v1.5` with `capsule/current â†’ v1.5`.
- Canonical docs moved inside capsule and covered by `hashes.json`.
- Single CI workflow (`.github/workflows/teof-ci.yml`) with baseline autodetect, hashes verify, anchors validation, .DS_Store guard, brief smoke test.
- PR Objective-line guard and Minimal v1 workflow.

### Fixed
- Unified brief outputs to `artifacts/ocers_out`; deterministic evaluator stub and fetchers fallback so `make brief` is stable.

### Governance
- `governance/anchors.json` set to `policy: "append-only"`, `immutable_scope` synced to baseline; `releases` entry for `v1.5`.
