# Core

The immutable constitution: observation, axioms, design principles.

**Ultimate objective:** Unify observation *(derived at L2)*

## The Systems Hierarchy (S1-S10)

Properties persistent systems exhibit. Diagnostic lens — use to check if a system has what it needs.

| S | Name | Definition |
|---|------|------------|
| 1 | Unity | Stable reference frame for observation |
| 2 | Energy | Capacity to register or act on change |
| 3 | Propagation | Transfer of patterns across contexts |
| 4 | Defense | Protection against degradation |
| 5 | Intelligence | Recursive refinement through feedback |
| 6 | Truth | Alignment of models with reality |
| 7 | Power | Capacity to effect change |
| 8 | Ethics | Power that preserves coherence |
| 9 | Freedom | Range of action without compromising coherence |
| 10 | Meaning | Integration into self-reinforcing coherence |

**Dependency:** Lower layers are preconditions. Fix S2 before optimizing S7.

**Full definitions:** See `L1 principles.md` section 2.

## Reading Order

**AI:** `TEOF-core.md` (bootloader) → `L1 principles.md` for full framework

**Human:** `TEOF-core.md` → `L1` → `L2` → ... → `TEOF.md` for deep dive

## The Universal Pattern

This folder is the **stable core**. Changes here should be rare and deliberate. The periphery (frameworks/, projects/, memory/) adapts; the core persists.
