# Layers (L)

**The derivation ladder from axiom to automation.**

L1-L6 describe how TEOF is organized — from principles through implementation. Generative — use to build or understand the framework.

## The Layers

| Layer | Name | Purpose | Mutation Rate |
|-------|------|---------|---------------|
| **L1** | Principles | Core axioms and derived rules | Rare |
| **L2** | Objectives | System goals derived from principles | Occasional |
| **L3** | Properties | Qualities required to achieve objectives | Occasional |
| **L4** | Architecture | File organization and structure | Moderate |
| **L5** | Workflow | AI navigation and routing | Moderate |
| **L6** | Automation | When and how to automate | As needed |

**Dependency:** Each layer depends on those above. L6 implements L5, which implements L4, etc. All trace back to 0.

## The Systems Hierarchy (S)

The S hierarchy (S1-S10) describes properties persistent systems exhibit — a diagnostic lens.

L1 (Principles) contains the full S hierarchy. See `core/README.md` for quick reference.
