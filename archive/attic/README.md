# TEOF Attic (archived, not part of current CLI)
- `seed-legacy/` — pre-v1.5 capsule seeding; kept for archaeology.
- `reports-YYYYMMDD/` — example OCERS outputs; not used by the CLI.
- `experimental-YYYYMMDD/` — playgrounds; not wired into `teof` commands.

Nothing here is imported by the current `teof` CLI. Move items back if you revive them.
