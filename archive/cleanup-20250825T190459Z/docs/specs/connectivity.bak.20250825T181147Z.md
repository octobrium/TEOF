# Connectivity & Emergence (Spec)

status: draft  
summary: Explore how mature TEOF units may link to form emergent, self-regulating networks—conceptual only.

## Purpose
Beyond independent growth (tree metaphor), TEOF units may develop **connective properties** (neural metaphor).  
This enables regulation, pruning, and emergent intelligence at the network level while remaining anchored to observation as primacy.

## Conceptual Properties
- **Staged Maturation** — differentiate → validate → then connect (fail-closed before linkage).
- **Latent Connectivity** — seeds carry the possibility of links; expression waits until post-validation.
- **Synaptogenesis** — links form deliberately; incoherent nodes/links are pruned.
- **Plasticity** — connections strengthen or attenuate proportional to coherence and utility.
- **Emergent Homeostasis** — networks correct drift and reinforce high-signal pathways.
- **Systemic Coherence** — evaluate not only node fitness but network-level alignment and stability.
- **Diversity with Anchor** — heterogeneous roles (structural, connective, functional) remain bound by the same DNA (TEOF axioms).

## Open Questions (Conceptual)
- What constitutes network-scale coherence signals (beyond node OCERS)?
- How to avoid over-connection and noise collapse while preserving adaptability?
- What forms of “organ systems” (specialized sub-networks) are desirable, and how are they recognized conceptually?
- How should speciation and recombination be declared at the network level?

> Scope: Concept only. Mechanisms (protocols, scores, data structures) belong in architecture/workflow when/if promoted.
