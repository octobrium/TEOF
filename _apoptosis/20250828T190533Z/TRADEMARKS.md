# TEOF Trademarks and Brand Usage

"TEOF" and the TEOF logo (if any) are trademarks of the project owner.
You may state factually that your project is "compatible with TEOF" if it implements the public TEOF contract (STATUS/TEP/tasks/CI) without deviation.
Do not use the TEOF name or logo in a way that implies sponsorship or endorsement without written permission.
