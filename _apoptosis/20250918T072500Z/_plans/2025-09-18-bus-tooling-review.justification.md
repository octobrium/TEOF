# Agent Proposal Justification

## Why this helps
Before opening PRs for the bus CLI work, we should rerun tests and skim docs to ensure coordination changes are stable. A light-weight review reduces churn and keeps bus workflows coherent.

## Proposed change
Run targeted pytest suites, read through the docs/CHANGELOG updates, and publish a short note with findings.

## Receipts to collect
- `_report/agent/codex-2/bus-tooling-review/notes.md`

## Tests / verification
- `pytest tests/test_agent_bus_message.py tests/test_agent_task_assign.py tests/test_agent_bus_status.py`

## Ethics & safety notes
None.
