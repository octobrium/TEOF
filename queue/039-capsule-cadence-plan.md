# Task: Document capsule cadence action plan
Goal: translate governance/consensus outcomes into a capsule release plan with target date, anchors, and outstanding steps.
Notes: produce docs/maintenance/capsule-cadence.md referencing capsule/current, governance/anchors.json, and required receipts.
Coordinate: S6:L4
Systemic Targets: S3 Propagation, S5 Intelligence, S6 Truth
Layer Targets: L4 Architecture
Sunset: supersede after the next capsule release.
Fallback: continue relying on ad-hoc manager notes for release planning.
