# Task: Session Guard Upgrade
Goal: enforce manifest alignment and agent branch conventions in session_boot so handoffs donâ€™t leak across seats.
Notes: add optional overrides for special cases; update docs with new guardrail + workflow guidance.
Coordinate: S3:L5
Systemic Targets: S1 Unity, S2 Energy, S3 Propagation, S6 Truth
Layer Targets: L5 Workflow
Sunset: when guard + docs + tests land.
Fallback: continue manual checks documented today.
