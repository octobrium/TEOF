# Task: Summarize L4 binding expectations
Goal: produce a short explainer that links governance bindings to concrete tests so reviewers can trace compliance quickly.
OCERS Target: Coherence↑ Reproducibility↑
Coordinate: S6:L4
Sunset: retire once the binding explainer ships and the bindings ledger references it.
Fallback: rely on docs/architecture.md footnotes until the brief lands.
