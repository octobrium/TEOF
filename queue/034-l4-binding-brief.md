# Task: Summarize L4 binding expectations
Goal: produce a short explainer that links governance bindings to concrete tests so reviewers can trace compliance quickly.
Coordinate: S6:L4
Systemic Targets: S3 Propagation, S5 Intelligence, S6 Truth
Layer Targets: L4 Architecture
Sunset: retire once the binding explainer ships and the bindings ledger references it.
Fallback: rely on docs/architecture.md footnotes until the brief lands.
