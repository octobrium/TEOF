# Task: Decentralized Node Incentive Ledger
Goal: codify governance, reputation, and reward mechanics for autonomous TEOF nodes so expansion remains principled and observable.
Status: proposed (2025-10-20T07:54Z)
Notes: Builds on `docs/ideas/decentralized-teof-node.md` and plan `2025-10-11-decentralized-node` step S3 to align incentives with CMD-1 (observation), CMD-5 (respect safeties), and CMD-7 (escalate uncertainty) before granting wider autonomy.
Coordinate: S8:L2
Systemic Targets: S2 Energy, S3 Propagation, S4 Defense, S7 Power, S8 Ethics
Layer Targets: L2 Objectives, L4 Architecture, L5 Workflow
Systemic Scale: 8
Principle Links: ensures S-layer growth, capsule releases, and node handshakes remain tied to append-only receipts and reversible governance anchors.
Sunset: when the ledger schema, documentation, and guard receipts land (e.g., `_report/usage/node-incentive-ledger/`) and automation enforces stake/reputation updates.
Fallback: continue manual stewardship of node trust via ad-hoc reflections and manager directives.

Readiness Checklist:
- docs/ideas/decentralized-teof-node.md
- _plans/2025-10-11-decentralized-node.plan.json
- docs/automation/decentralized-propagation.md
- tools/autonomy/node_runner.py

Receipts to Extend:
- `_report/usage/node-incentive-ledger/` (new) tracking reputation updates + governance approvals
- `governance/anchors.json` entry documenting incentive policy adoption
