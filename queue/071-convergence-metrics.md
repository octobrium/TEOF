# Task: Convergence Metrics Pipeline
Goal: instrument reconciliation metrics (hash alignment, receipt coverage, anchor latency, commandment adoption) so multi-node TEOF deployments prove systemic coherence over time.
Status: proposed (2025-10-20T07:54Z)
Notes: Implements the follow-ups in `docs/reflections/20250917-convergence-metrics.md`, reinforcing CMD-1 (observe first), CMD-4 (reproduce), and CMD-6 (invite peer review) while guarding against silent divergence across nodes.
Coordinate: S6:L6
Systemic Targets: S3 Propagation, S4 Defense, S5 Intelligence, S6 Truth
Layer Targets: L6 Automation, L5 Workflow
Systemic Scale: 6
Principle Links: keeps the alignment trail auditable as adoption scales by logging metrics alongside decentralized receipt sync receipts.
Sunset: when `python -m tools.network.convergence_metrics` (or equivalent) writes `_report/reconciliation/metrics.jsonl`, dashboards surface trends, and CI blocks drift without receipts.
Fallback: rely on manual inspection of receipt_sync outputs and reflections without trend tracking.

Readiness Checklist:
- docs/reflections/20250917-convergence-metrics.md
- tools/network/receipt_sync.py
- _report/network/
- memory/log.jsonl

Receipts to Extend:
- `_report/reconciliation/metrics.jsonl` (new) storing metric snapshots + hashes
- `_report/usage/convergence-dashboard/` summarising trends for managers
