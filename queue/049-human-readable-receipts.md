# Task: Generate human-readable receipt summaries
Goal: produce concise narratives from machine receipts so operators can scan systemic progress without diffing JSON.
Notes: extend autonomy status tooling (e.g. `tools/agent/autonomy_status.py`) or add a sibling CLI to render proofs-of-work per plan/backlog item.
Coordinate: S3:L5
Systemic Targets: S3 Propagation, S5 Intelligence, S6 Truth
Layer Targets: L5 Workflow
Sunset: when dashboards surface auto-generated briefs for every `_report/usage/*` receipt.
Fallback: manual interpretation of raw JSON receipts.
