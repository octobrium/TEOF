# Task: Code Compaction Backlog
Goal: catalogue areas where the OCERS kernel, tooling, or docs can shed duplicate logic and shrink footprint without changing behaviour.
Notes: collect candidates during current automation wave (shared heuristics, scaffolding, heartbeat). When ready, spin a dedicated plan to measure before/after LOC and ensure receipts/tests guard regression.
OCERS Target: Reproducibility↑ Self-repair↑
Sunset: revisit once automation wave lands and compaction plan is scoped.
Fallback: manual review via maintenance-pruning playbook if automation stalls.

Priority Ladder: High (once automation wave completes)
