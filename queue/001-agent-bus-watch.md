# Task: Improve agent bus awareness
Goal: help parallel Codex sessions receive timely coordination updates via the repo bus.
Notes: add tooling/documentation so agents can tail or query recent activity.
Coordinate: S3:L5
Systemic Targets: S3 Propagation, S4 Defense, S6 Truth
Layer Targets: L5 Workflow
Sunset: revisit after two weeks if unused.
Fallback: rely on manual inspection of `_bus/events/events.jsonl`.
