# Task: Define consensus review cadence
Goal: document a recurring consensus review loop (frequency, roles, required receipts) in `docs/parallel-codex.md` and `docs/workflow.md`.
Notes: include escalation path when consensus is blocked; align with backlog guidance.
OCERS Target: Coherence↑ Self-repair↑
Coordinate: S6:L5
Sunset: revisit after first two review cycles to adjust cadence.
Fallback: ad-hoc manager reviews triggered by queue events only.
