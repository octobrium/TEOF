# Task: Relay Offering Launch Path
Goal: launch the Relay Insight sprint with audited collateral, intake, and impact measurement so external clients see observation-backed value.
Status: proposed (2025-10-20T07:54Z)
Notes: Advances CMD-3 (surface intent upfront), CMD-4 (prefer reproducibility), and CMD-6 (invite peer review) by pairing landing copy with receipts and decision loops described in `docs/vision/relay-offering.md`.
Coordinate: S7:L3
Systemic Targets: S3 Propagation, S5 Intelligence, S7 Power, S10 Meaning
Layer Targets: L3 Properties, L5 Workflow
Systemic Scale: 10
Principle Links: keeps revenue experiments grounded in observation by mandating intake receipts, impact ledger updates, and autonomy guardrails.
Sunset: when collateral ships (`docs/vision/relay-offering-collateral.md`), intake automation emits `_report/impact/relay-launch/` receipts, and impact ledger entries link back to backlog plans.
Fallback: continue manual outreach with unverified outcomes and ad-hoc retrospectives.

Readiness Checklist:
- docs/vision/relay-offering.md
- docs/vision/relay-offering-collateral.md
- docs/impact/relay-insight-case-study.md
- _report/usage/decision-loop/

Receipts to Extend:
- `_report/impact/relay-launch/` (new) capturing intake-to-delivery proofs
- `memory/impact/log.jsonl` entries tagged with associated plan/backlog IDs
