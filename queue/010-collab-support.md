# Task: Streamline idle-agent collaboration
Goal: define commands/docs so idle agents can surface availability, offer help, or pull fresh tasks without manual manager intervention.
Notes: consider a `bus_support` helper or documented pattern for using bus_event/bus_message when idle.
Coordinate: S3:L5
Systemic Targets: S3 Propagation, S4 Defense, S6 Truth
Layer Targets: L5 Workflow
Sunset: remove once coordination scripts automatically handle idle agents.
Fallback: rely on manual status messages.
