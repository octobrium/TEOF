# Task: Publish Relay Insight case study
Goal: turn the captured sprint receipts into a public-facing narrative + impact ledger entry. **Status: done (2025-10-03T19:28Z)**
Notes: receipts are complete (command log, conductor run, diff/test). Narrative published under `docs/impact/relay-insight-case-study.md`; public-facing summary lives at `docs/impact/relay-insight-public.md`; impact ledger + memory logs updated. Further changes require new task.
OCERS Target: Evidence↑ Outreach↑
Coordinate: S5:L5
Sunset: closed once narrative + ledger entry merged and external asset shipped (complete).
Fallback: schedule manager review if publish wave stalls; escalate via manager-report thread.
