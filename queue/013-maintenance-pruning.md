# Task: Establish pruning cadence
Goal: define and execute a sweep to trim stale plans, receipts, and bulky docs, leaving the repo lean for new sessions.
Notes: preserve governance append-only rules; prefer archiving over deletion when provenance matters.
Coordinate: S5:L5
Systemic Targets: S1 Unity, S2 Energy, S4 Defense, S5 Intelligence, S10 Meaning
Layer Targets: L5 Workflow
Sunset: revisit cadence after two successful sweeps.
Fallback: document backlog and escalate to manager.
