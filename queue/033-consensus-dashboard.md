# Task: Build consensus status dashboard
Goal: create a lightweight dashboard (CLI or Markdown generator) summarizing open consensus decisions, assigned reviewers, and receipt status.
Notes: source data from `_bus/events/events.jsonl`, `_bus/messages/manager-report.jsonl`, and `_report/consensus/`.
Coordinate: S6:L4
Systemic Targets: S1 Unity, S2 Energy, S6 Truth
Layer Targets: L4 Architecture
Sunset: replace with capsule-grade UI once consensus tooling hardens.
Fallback: maintain a manual status table in manager reports.
