# Task: Document L4 architecture bindings
Goal: Draft doc mapping architecture layer rules to enforcement hooks (policy checks, plan validation, capsule freeze).
Notes: Include checklist linking each L4 rule to verifying artifact; cross-link workflow + architecture docs.
Coordinate: S6:L4
Systemic Targets: S3 Propagation, S5 Intelligence, S6 Truth
Layer Targets: L4 Architecture
Sunset: evaluate after implementation.
Fallback: keep relying on implicit knowledge in existing docs.
