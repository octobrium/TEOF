# Task: Pre-review bus CLI refactor outputs
Goal: run targeted tests and skim docs/CHANGELOG updates before the PR opens.
Notes: hit pytest suites for bus_message/task_assign/bus_status, record notes, and share feedback via bus.
Coordinate: S3:L5
Systemic Targets: S3 Propagation, S6 Truth
Layer Targets: L5 Workflow
Sunset: close once feedback is shared or PR merges.
Fallback: defer review to PR stage only.
