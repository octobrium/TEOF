# Task: Automate pruning helper
Goal: ship `tools/maintenance/prune_artifacts.py` with tests and doc updates so stale plans/receipts move into `_apoptosis/` automatically.
Notes: support `--dry-run` and configurable cutoff.
OCERS Target: Self-repair↑ Reproducibility↑
Sunset: revisit after integrating into CI.
Fallback: keep following manual pruning cadence.
