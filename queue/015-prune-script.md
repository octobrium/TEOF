# Task: Automate pruning helper
Goal: ship `tools/maintenance/prune_artifacts.py` with tests and doc updates so stale plans/receipts move into `_apoptosis/` automatically.
Notes: support `--dry-run` and configurable cutoff.
Coordinate: S5:L6
Systemic Targets: S4 Defense, S5 Intelligence, S6 Truth, S10 Meaning
Layer Targets: L6 Automation
Sunset: revisit after integrating into CI.
Fallback: keep following manual pruning cadence.
