# Report Examples (Static)

This folder holds **small, stable report snapshots** for docs/discussion.
They are **not** produced by the build and are safe to version.

Guidelines:
- Keep examples tiny and illustrative; redact/trim large arrays.
- Use `.json` with stable ordering and minimal whitespace.
- If a snapshot becomes a contract, move a **minimal** version to
  `branches_thick/tests/goldens/reports/` and enforce it in CI.

# artifacts/reports/ (Runtime)

This directory is for **generated** report outputs at run time.
It is **git-ignored on purpose**. Anything here was produced locally or in CI.

- For documentation examples, place a tiny static copy in `docs/examples/reports/`.
- For CI baselines, use `branches_thick/tests/goldens/reports/` with a minimal fixture.
