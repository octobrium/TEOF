## Patterns
- **Government & Think Tanks**: good on *Observation* and *Ethics*, weak on *Self-Repair*.  
- **Corporate PR**: lowest *Ethics*, but moderate *Coherence*.  
- **Neutral journalism**: strong *Reproducibility*.  
- **Social media**: volatile, often failing *Coherence* and *Self-Repair*.  

---

## Top 3 Insights
1. *Self-Repair* is the weakest pillar across all texts.  
2. *Ethics* diverges sharply: corporate & social are low, academic & journalism are high.  
3. *Observation* scores higher when uncertainty is admitted explicitly.

## Limitations
- Scores here are hypothetical; true scores depend on running OCERS evaluations.  
- Reference set is English-only and text-only; future iterations should expand scope.
