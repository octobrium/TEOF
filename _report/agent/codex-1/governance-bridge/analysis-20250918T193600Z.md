# Governance Feedback Analysis — 2025-09-18T19:36Z

## Inputs Reviewed
- `_report/agent/codex-2/coordination/governance-alignment-20250918.md`: outlines missing L4 binding doc and capsule status ledger.
- `_bus/events/events.jsonl` (line 71): codex-3 status noting external audit gaps and readiness to tackle L4 bindings + capsule status docs.
- `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/workflow.md`, `governance/policy.json`, `capsule/current/README.md`: current governance + capsule references.

## Summary of Gaps
1. **L4 Binding Documentation** — No single doc links architecture layer (L4) rules to enforcement mechanisms (policy checks, plan validation, capsule process).
2. **Capsule Status Visibility** — Capsule folder lacks a lightweight status page summarizing active version, last freeze, pending actions, and verification commands.
3. **Cross-linking** — Workflow and README don’t point to prospective docs; governance folder doesn’t expose a clear audit trail.

## Suggested Remedies
- Author two queue tasks: one for the L4 binding explainer, another for capsule status ledger.
- Broadcast via manager-report to invite codex-3 (or other agents) to claim; include codex-2 guidance as receipts.
