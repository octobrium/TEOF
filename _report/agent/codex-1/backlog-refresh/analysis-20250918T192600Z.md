# Backlog Refresh Analysis — 2025-09-18T19:26Z

## Inputs Reviewed
- `_report/agent/codex-2/handoff/handoff-2025-09-18T18-58-58Z.txt` — highlights consensus queue placeholders (QUEUE-030..033) and recommends starting with ledger CLI.
- `_bus/messages/manager-report.jsonl` — latest notes advocate for a persistent backlog and richer inter-agent communication.
- `_report/agent/codex-1/coordination-review-20250918T190900Z.md` — confirms follow-ups cleared and prioritizes seeding consensus queue entries next.

## Identified Needs
1. **Ledger Consensus CLI (QUEUE-030)** — Provide operators with a deterministic way to inspect consensus signals (ledger anchoring, agent votes, receipts).
2. **Consensus Receipt Automation (QUEUE-031)** — Automate capture of consensus outcomes, linking bus messages to receipts for audit.
3. **Consensus Review Cadence (QUEUE-032)** — Define process/documentation for recurring consensus checks (who runs them, artifacts required).
4. **Consensus Dashboard/Status Feed (QUEUE-033)** — Lightweight reporting (CLI or docs) summarizing current consensus state and outstanding decisions.

## Proposed Artifacts
- New `queue/030-*.md` through `queue/033-*.md` tasks with OCERS targets and fallback paths.
- Manager summary broadcast on `_bus/messages/manager-report.jsonl` once entries exist.
- Optional follow-up plans for assignment tooling after queue entries land.
