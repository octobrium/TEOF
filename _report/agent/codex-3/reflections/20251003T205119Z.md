# Session Reflection — codex-3 (2025-10-03T20:51:19Z)

## What worked
- Duplicate-key guard landed smoothly once we captured pytest receipts; validator pointers made remediation obvious.
- Coordination docs + session_boot tip now agree with the live CLI, so newcomers should dodge the old `--task` flag trap.
- Plan receipts stayed current (pytest + planner validate summary), which made consensus messaging easy to justify.

## Friction / gaps
- `bus_claim` keeps old `released_at` fields even after re-claiming; the guard refuses status updates until we scrub it manually.
- Manager-report still has a mix of legacy `bus_watch --task` snippets; worth a repo-wide grep before the next sweep.
- Pre-existing dirty tree/untracked files make it hard to stage a push-ready diff without more housekeeping.

## Proposed refinements
1. Teach `bus_claim` to clear `released_at` when a fresh claim is created for the same task so the guard doesn’t require manual JSON edits.
2. Add a lightweight `tools.agent.docs_sync guards` command that lint-checks docs for stale CLI snippets (bus_watch, session_boot flags, etc.).
3. Schedule a hygiene pass on `_report/usage/onboarding` to archive or consolidate dated quickstart receipts; the clutter is blocking clean pushes.

## Follow-up
- Implemented the `bus_claim` improvement and added a `--clear-notes` flag so reclaiming tasks no longer leaves stale timestamps or notes behind.
