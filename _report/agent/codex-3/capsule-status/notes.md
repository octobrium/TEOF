# Capsule Status Audit â€” 2025-09-18

- `capsule/current` points to `v1.6`.
- `capsule/v1.5/` and `capsule/v1.6/` contain README, PROVENANCE, hashes; no STATUS file.
- External review expects `capsule/README.md` + per-version status markers.
- Need to mention status workflow in docs/architecture.md (capsule section) and docs/workflow.md (release guidance).
