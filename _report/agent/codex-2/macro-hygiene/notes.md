- Reflection: paused before progressing QUEUE-036 because I was uncertain whether seeding the task required manager confirmation. Identified that lack of explicit auto-progression guidance causes hesitation. Goal added to macro hygiene objectives to clarify triggers so agents execute without extra approvals.

- Environment hygiene: `AGENT_MANIFEST.json` currently points to codex-4 while codex-2 is active; no helper automates swapping manifests/branch prefixes, leaving tree dirty after sessions.
- CI coverage: `.github/workflows/guardrails.yml` only runs hash/append-only checks; new helpers (prune_artifacts, consensus CLIs, manager heartbeat) have no CI execution yet.
- Capsule cadence: `governance/anchors.json` last event is 2025-08-26; no releases recorded since v1.6. Need schedule + tasks to align upcoming governance/consensus work with next freeze.

- Proposed actions:
  1. Author `tools/agent/manifest_swap.py` (or update runner) to automate manifest/branch swap; add mini-guide in docs/maintenance/macro-hygiene.md and ensure manifests per agent tracked under `_report/agent/...`.
  2. Extend CI (`guardrails.yml`) with matrix job invoking `pytest tests/test_prune_artifacts.py tests/test_consensus_cli.py` and `python -m tools.agent.bus_status --help` to ensure new helpers stay green.
  3. Draft capsule cadence doc (QUEUE-035 dependency) and create checklist for next freeze: identify blockers, schedule freeze date, update anchors once consensus/governance docs land.

- Broadcast plan on manager-report; next action is to slice follow-up tasks after governance docs deliver so schedule can lock.
