- Refreshed docs/agents.md and docs/workflow.md with claim_seed guard coverage plus session_brief reference.
- Highlighted the bus_message claim guard dependency so managers seed before calling task_assign.
- Follow-up when `python -m tools.agent.session_brief` ships on main; rerun the command as part of verification.

- Flagged both docs sections with fallback instructions because `claim_seed`/`session_brief` CLIs are not yet merged; coordination note dropped on QUEUE-014.
