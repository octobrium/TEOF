# Governance Trim â€” S2/S3 Draft Notes (2025-09-18)

- `.github/AGENT_ONBOARDING.md` reduced to a five-step checklist that links to canonical coordination and policy docs; added explicit planner validation requirement and policy anchor list.
- `docs/agents.md` now points to onboarding + playbook for duplicated loops, condenses idle cadence guidance, and appends shared policy anchors.
- `docs/parallel-codex.md` referenced onboarding upfront and added explicit anchors (`session-loop`, `self-audit`, `follow-up-logging`) for other docs to deep-link.
- Remaining work: review links, update Governance Trim plan statuses, capture final diff summary, rerun planner validation (`python3 tools.planner.validate.py --strict`).

Receipts for plan S2/S3 before finalization; additional delta report to follow once wording is locked.
