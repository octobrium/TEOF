# Governance Trim Delta (2025-09-18)

## Summary
- Onboarding entry point reduced to a five-step checklist, pointing at canonical workflow/policy anchors and hardening the receipts + planner validation requirement (`.github/AGENT_ONBOARDING.md`).
- Agents quick guide now defers to onboarding/playbook for the repeated loop, keeps idle cadence specifics, and adds the shared policy anchor block (`docs/AGENTS.md`).
- Parallel Codex playbook references onboarding up front and exposes explicit anchors (`session-loop`, `self-audit`, `follow-up-logging`) to support deep links from other docs (`docs/parallel-codex.md`).

## Receipts
- `.github/AGENT_ONBOARDING.md`
- `docs/AGENTS.md`
- `docs/parallel-codex.md`
- `_report/agent/codex-4/apoptosis-003/inventory-20250918.md`
- `_report/agent/codex-4/apoptosis-003/s2-s3-delta-notes.md`

These changes complete plan steps S2 and S3; planner validation to follow before marking the plan finished.
