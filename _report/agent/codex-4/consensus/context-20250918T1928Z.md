# Consensus Backlog Context — 2025-09-18T19:28Z

## Key Sources
- `_report/agent/codex-2/handoff/handoff-2025-09-18T18-58-58Z.txt` — flags consensus queues (030–033) as the next focus area and suggests starting with a ledger CLI (QUEUE-030).
- `_report/agent/codex-1/coordination-review-20250918T190900Z.md` — repeats the need to assign ownership for QUEUE-030..033 after verifying pruning receipts; references the codex-2 handoff for details.
- `_plans/2025-09-18-backlog-refresh.plan.json` — codex-1’s in-progress manager plan to draft the queue items; currently paused at step S1 (review consensus needs).
- `_plans/2025-09-17-convergence-metrics.plan.json`, `_plans/2025-09-17-metrics-aggregate.plan.json`, `_plans/2025-09-17-metrics-jsonl.plan.json` — recently completed groundwork around reconciliation/metrics that consensus queues are expected to extend.
- `_report/runner/20250917T220635Z-13b70e44.json` and `_report/runner/20250917T204119Z-279e13b9.json` — receipts demonstrating the metrics aggregation pipelines now available to feed consensus logic.

## Candidate Queue Themes
- **QUEUE-030 — Ledger CLI**: Provide a deterministic CLI wrapper over `_report/ledger.csv` to expose batch summaries, risk, and accept-rate signals (per codex-2 handoff). Likely surfaces OCERS-aligned summaries for consensus checkpoints and should emit receipts in `_report/runner/` when invoked in CI.
- **QUEUE-031 — Consensus Artifact Schema**: Define the JSON/CSV envelope for storing multi-run consensus outcomes (building on `tests/test_reconcile_*` and metrics reflections). Needs to specify OCERS targets and how artifacts tie back to `_report/` receipts.
- **QUEUE-032 — Runner/CI Hook**: Integrate the consensus checks into `tools/runner.sh` or a new CI step so the ledger + metrics feed decision gates. Should borrow patterns from `tools/maintenance/prune_artifacts.py` for dry-run safety.
- **QUEUE-033 — Manager Reporting**: Extend `tools.agent.manager_report` (or provide a sibling CLI) to summarise consensus health and ledger status for human reviewers. Expected to reference the schema from QUEUE-031 and align with the follow-up logging habit just documented.

These themes are inferred from available plans and receipts; manager confirmation is needed before we freeze queue text.

## Open Questions / Gaps
1. Does QUEUE-030 need to mutate the ledger or stay read-only? (Receipts do not specify whether automation already writes rows.)
2. What convergence or confidence thresholds define “consensus pass/fail”? Existing reflections mention metrics but not acceptance criteria.
3. Should consensus outputs live under `_report/consensus/` or integrate with existing `_report/runner/` dumps?
4. Are there dependency ordering rules (e.g., schema before CI hook) that the queue numbering should enforce?

## Recommended Next Actions
- Confirm with codex-1 whether the above theme mapping matches their intent before drafting queue markdown.
- Once approved, author `queue/030-ledger-cli.md` et al., each with OCERS targets and required receipts, then attach them to manager plan `2025-09-18-backlog-refresh` (step S2).
- Ensure each new queue item points to the relevant prior receipts so reviewers can trace provenance.
