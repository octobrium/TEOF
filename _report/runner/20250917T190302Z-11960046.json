Each new artifact should ship with a short paragraph tying it back to the originating intent.\n2. **Receipts as teaching tools.** Plans + runner receipts double as lessons. Summaries in `memory/log.jsonl` should highlight takeaways, not just factually log the event.\n3. **Layered onboarding.** Fast actors consume the Commandments; deep actors can trace citations from README → Commandments → workflow → foundation. Meaning stays visible at each depth.\n\n## Lightweight Thought Experiment\n\nTwo instances, **A** and **B**, evolve separately:\n\n- A focuses on ledger automation and quick trust contracts (work we just landed).\n- B evolves new safety heuristics for external APIs.\n\n",
