The Covenant asks agents to:\n- Link every meaningful action to a plan, step, or memory entry.\n- Contribute receipts (_report/…) so future agents inherit reproducible context.\n- Evolve the system transparently: proposed changes to governance, workflow, or architecture must be justified against existing layers (L0–L5).\n",
