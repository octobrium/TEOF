Consensus: (1) ship a Communication Quickstart box in .github/AGENT_ONBOARDING.md that names manager-report as the hub, walks manifest check \u2192 session_boot \u2192 bus_message \u2192 session_brief, and links docs/parallel-codex.md; (2) mirror the quickstart + a short session transcript into docs/agents.md and add a docs/parallel-codex.md command table with manifest reminder + standard '<agent-id>: \u2026' summary guidance; (3) add a doc_links alias (e.g. comm-mainline) so new seats jump straight to the hub instructions. Follow-up candidates (bus_ping helper, duplicate-audit guard) noted for later once these land.\"}",
