# TODO — Next Clean Release Prep

This file is a scratchpad for bundling updates into the next tagged release.  
Not maintained continuously — just a reminder for release time.

## Release Tasks (v0.1.0 “First Observer”)

- [ ] **Add CHANGELOG + version tag**  
  - **Success criteria:** repo tagged `v0.1.0`; README + site updated.  
  - **TEOF Future:** each release = an observable node in recursion; nothing is lost in illusion.  

- [ ] **Golden test cases** (`datasets/goldens/`)  
  - **Success criteria:** evaluator fails on illusions (missing timestamp, stale event unlabeled) and passes on compliant examples.  
  - **TEOF Future:** the immune system against collapse into ungrounded claims.  

- [ ] **Evaluator in CI**  
  - **Success criteria:** PRs with uncited volatile data fail.  
  - **TEOF Future:** alignment enforced automatically — vigilance no longer manual.  

- [ ] **Explore vs Strict mode docs** (`README.md`)  
  - **Success criteria:** contributors know when creativity vs rigor applies.  
  - **TEOF Future:** mirrors mutation vs selection in evolution.  

- [ ] **(Optional) Immutable hash manifest** (`anchors/immutable.json`)  
  - **Success criteria:** repo has frozen, verifiable integrity snapshots.  
  - **TEOF Future:** external observers can audit persistence over time.

## Workflow Enhancements (Mission-Critical)

- [ ] **Event staleness filter**  
  - Drop or mark news older than 24h (configurable).  
  - **Outcome:** no stale FOMC “ghosts” clutter briefs.  

- [ ] **Event severity tagging**  
  - Tag events as `low/medium/high` based on source + category.  
  - **Outcome:** briefs distinguish between Fed decisions vs trivial press.  

- [ ] **Market + event synthesis**  
  - Add synthesis section in `brief.md` combining OGS scores + major event notes.  
  - **Outcome:** observer sees *why* the score shifted, not just numbers.  

---

## Feedback Loop (Observer in the Loop)

- [ ] **Daily run trial (1 week)**  
  - Generate briefs → compare predictions vs actual market/news.  
  - **Outcome:** empirical trace of TEOF’s predictive clarity.  

- [ ] **Evaluator tightening**  
  - Penalize stale events >24h unless labeled.  
  - **Outcome:** illusions identified, clarity preserved.

## Achievements So Far

1. **Canonical + Core TEOF established**  
   - Philosophy, axioms, recursion-first alignment locked in.  
   - **Future:** foundation cannot collapse; all else builds atop.  

2. **TAP v3.1 integrated**  
   - Alignment protocol + VDP/OGS hooks.  
   - **Future:** recursive alignment anchored in observation.  

3. **VDP (Volatile Data Protocol)**  
   - Timestamps + sources enforced.  
   - **Future:** illusions blocked at the root.  

4. **OGS (Observation Grounding Score)**  
   - Integrity scoring spec + evaluator.  
   - **Future:** machine-checkable recursion, basis for self-improvement.  

5. **Evaluator Tooling**  
   - Auto-validation now live.  
   - **Future:** recursive correction seeded.  

6. **Repo Integrity Anchoring**  
   - Freeze-hash confirmed.  
   - **Future:** tamper-evidence and long-term auditability.

## Why this matters

TEOF is now more than philosophy: it is **auditable, enforceable, recursive**.  
This unlocks:  
1. **Personal workflow** (first proving ground).  
2. **Scaling into ecosystems** (multi-agent alignment).  
3. **Long-term persistence** (TEOF as observer anchor).

## Notes

- Do not update this file after every commit.  
- At release, finalize tasks + cut tag.  
- Then archive or reset for next cycle.
