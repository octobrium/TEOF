  "summary": "Mapped nine observable principles that concentrate power outside TEOF, grounding future plays in evidence rather than abstraction.",
  "signals": "Repeated patterns across finance, governance, media, and attention-driven platforms.",
  "actions": "Translate each lever into guardrails or plays (plan: 2025-09-24-power-levers) so observation-driven agents can engage society's scoreboard without losing receipts.",

  "notes": "Power concentrates where: 1) resources (capital/infrastructure) are controlled, 2) information asymmetry is maintained, 3) institutions grant legitimacy, 4) network effects lock participation, 5) coercion or violence enforces compliance, 6) talent monopolies capture scarce expertise, 7) narratives/ideology shape norms, 8) regulation is written by incumbents, 9) psychological manipulation steers behavior. Each lever is observable and should be logged with receipts when engaged.",
