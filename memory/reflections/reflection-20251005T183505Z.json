  "notes": "What went well: receipt regeneration + autonomy_status wiring confirmed the readiness surface without touching the userâ€™s parallel work. Friction: inherited dirty tree created a long tail of stash juggling; the receipts_hygiene CLI still exits 1 on known long-tail plans, which looks like a failure. Improvement: add an opt-in override to receipts_hygiene to treat known archival plans as informational, and teach session_boot to snapshot the preexisting stash list so the next agent sees the backlog without manual spelunking.",
