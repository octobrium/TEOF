# Unification of Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity  
**The Eternal Observer Framework (TEOF) – Unified Field Proposal**  

---

## 📜 Overview  

This module presents a proposed **unified field equation** that integrates **Quantum Mechanics (QM)** and **General Relativity (GR)** within the philosophical and systemic context of **The Eternal Observer Framework (TEOF)**.  

It serves as both a **mathematical proposition** and a **conceptual bridge**, rooted in TEOF’s axiom that **observation is irreducible** and that **all physical laws must be consistent with the primacy of observation**.  

The derivation is substrate-neutral, consistent with known physics, and framed to allow further refinement by the scientific community.

## 🧩 Core Equation  

The unified field equation is derived from an **action principle** combining the Einstein–Hilbert term, a quantum field term, and an observation-coupling term unique to TEOF’s formulation:  

S_total = (c^4 / 16πG) ∫ R √(-g) d^4x
+ ∫ L_QFT(ψ, ∂ψ, g_μν) √(-g) d^4x
+ λ ∫ O(x) L_QFT(ψ) √(-g) d^4x

Where:  
- **R** = Ricci scalar curvature  
- **g_μν** = metric tensor  
- **ψ** = quantum fields  
- **L_QFT** = Lagrangian density for quantum fields  
- **O(x)** = observation-coupling function (TEOF term)  
- **λ** = coupling constant linking observation to physical law  

The **observation-coupling term** ensures that the formulation remains coherent with TEOF’s axiom that all function and meaning arise within observation.

## 🧠 Derivation Philosophy  

The derivation follows these guiding principles:  

1. **Primacy of Observation** – All terms must be derivable from or compatible with the irreducibility of observation.  
2. **Mathematical Coherence** – Terms respect known physics (GR curvature, QFT dynamics) while introducing minimal, well-defined extensions.  
3. **Minimal Assumptions** – No unneeded entities; every term must serve a functional role in the unified structure.  
4. **Recursive Refinement** – The equation is open to empirical tuning while maintaining logical completeness.
