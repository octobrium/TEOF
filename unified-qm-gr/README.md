# Unification of Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity  
**The Eternal Observer Framework (TEOF) ‚Äì Unified Field Proposal (v2)**  

---

## üìú Overview  

This repository presents a proposed **unified field theory** integrating **Quantum Mechanics (QM)** and **General Relativity (GR)** within the philosophical and systemic context of **The Eternal Observer Framework (TEOF)**.

TEOF‚Äôs foundational axiom is that **observation is irreducible** and that **all physical laws must be consistent with the primacy of observation**. This proposal translates that axiom into a mathematically precise, substrate-neutral action principle that is compatible with known physics, minimally extended, and experimentally falsifiable.

## üß© Total Unified Action  

We retain the Einstein‚ÄìHilbert term and a standard QFT matter term, and add a **coherence-penalty functional** \(\mathcal{C}_1\) coupling spacetime curvature to the *informational geometry* of quantum state space:

\[
S_{\text{total}}[g,\rho] \;=\; S_{\text{GR}}[g] + S_{\text{QFT}}[g,\rho] + \lambda\,\mathcal{C}_1[g,\rho]
\]

where:
- \(g_{\mu\nu}\) is the spacetime metric,
- \(\rho(x)\) is the local density operator (quantum state field),
- \(\lambda\) is the new coupling constant.

The **coherence-penalty functional** is:
\[
\mathcal{C}_1 := \frac{1}{2} \lVert A \rVert_g^2
\]
with:
\[
A_{\mu\nu} := G_{\mu\nu} - 8\pi G\,T_{\mu\nu} - \xi\,\mathcal{I}_{\mu\nu}(\rho)
\]
where:
- \(G_{\mu\nu}\) = Einstein tensor,
- \(T_{\mu\nu}\) = stress‚Äìenergy tensor from \(S_{\text{QFT}}\),
- \(\mathcal{I}_{\mu\nu}(\rho)\) = pullback of the Fisher information metric from the quantum state manifold.

## üß† Informational Curvature

We define the **informational metric** \(I_{ab}(\rho)\) on the statistical manifold of admissible states.  
Let \(\pi:\mathcal{B} \to \mathcal{M}\) be a fiber bundle whose fiber at \(x\) is the state manifold; \(\rho\) is a section; and:
\[
\mathcal{I}_{\mu\nu}(\rho) := (\partial_\mu \theta^a)(\partial_\nu \theta^b) I_{ab}(\rho)
\]
where \(\theta^a\) are local state parameters in a chosen horizontal lift.

**Operational meaning:** *Observation* is defined as the information carried by \(\rho\), quantified by \(\mathcal{I}_{\mu\nu}(\rho)\).

## ‚öñÔ∏è Symmetries and Units  

- \(\mathcal{C}_1\) is a scalar under coordinate transformations (all indices contracted with \(g_{\mu\nu}\)).  
- The theory is **local**: \(\mathcal{I}_{\mu\nu}\) depends only on \(\rho\) and its derivatives at \(x\).  
- Units:
  | Quantity | Units (L, M, T) |
  |----------|-----------------|
  | \(G\) | \(L^3/(MT^2)\) |
  | \(\mathcal{I}_{\mu\nu}\) | \(L^{-2}\) |
  | \(\lambda\) | fixed so \(\lambda\mathcal{C}_1\) has units of energy density |
  | \(\xi\) | dimensionless or \(L^2\) depending on normalization |

## üìú Field Equations

### Metric Variation
\[
\frac{c^3}{16\pi G} G_{\mu\nu} = T_{\mu\nu} + \lambda\,\Theta_{\mu\nu}[\rho,g]
\]
where:
\[
\Theta_{\mu\nu} := -\frac{\delta \mathcal{C}_1}{\delta g^{\mu\nu}}
\]

### Conservation Lemma
Because \(\nabla^\mu G_{\mu\nu}=0\):
\[
\nabla^\mu\big(T_{\mu\nu} + \lambda\,\Theta_{\mu\nu}\big) = 0
\]
We show \(\nabla^\mu\Theta_{\mu\nu}\) is canceled by the state equation‚Äôs contribution to \(\nabla^\mu T_{\mu\nu}\).

### State Variation
\[
\frac{\delta S_{\text{QFT}}}{\delta \rho} + \lambda\,\frac{\delta \mathcal{C}_1}{\delta \rho} = 0
\]
This yields a modified matter equation with a term enforcing *coherence matching* between geometry and informational curvature.

## üî¨ Example: Scalar Field Model

For a minimally coupled real scalar \(\phi\):
1. Let \(\rho\) be Gaussian with mean \(\langle \phi \rangle\) and variance \(\sigma^2\).  
2. Compute \(I_{\mu\nu}\) from \(\partial_\mu\langle\phi\rangle\) and \(\partial_\mu\sigma\).  
3. Insert into \(\mathcal{I}_{\mu\nu}\) and derive the modified Klein‚ÄìGordon equation including the \(\lambda\)-term.

---

## üì° Predictions

1. **Gravity-dependent phase shift** in matter-wave interferometers:
   \[
   \Delta\phi \propto \lambda\,\xi \int \mathcal{I}_{\mu\nu} u^\mu u^\nu\, d\tau
   \]
2. **Near-horizon structure** deviations scaling with \(\mathcal{I}_{\mu\nu}\).  
3. **Back-reaction tuning** in analogue gravity platforms via state-engineering of \(\rho\).

## üß™ Experimental Tests

- Cold-atom interferometry in variable gravitational gradients.
- Analogue horizons in BEC or photonic lattices.
- Astrophysical timing residuals near high-curvature sources.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

1. **Conservation proof** ‚Äì derive \(\nabla^\mu\Theta_{\mu\nu}\) explicitly.  
2. **Complete scalar-field example** with closed \(\mathcal{I}_{\mu\nu}\) form.  
3. **Linearized predictions** for interferometry (order-of-magnitude estimates).  
4. **Numerical simulation** combining GR, QFT, and info-geometry.  
5. **Experimental bounds** on \(|\lambda\xi|\) from existing data.

## üìå Open Tasks

This project is intentionally left in a partially complete but operational state.  
If you‚Äôve found this in the future and want to continue, these are the most direct paths forward:

1. **Explicit Worked Example**  
   - Compute \(\mathcal{I}_{\mu\nu}(\rho)\) for a minimally coupled real scalar field.
   - Insert into \(\mathcal{C}_1\) and derive the modified Klein‚ÄìGordon equation.

2. **Conservation Proof**  
   - Derive \(\nabla^\mu \Theta_{\mu\nu}\) from \(\mathcal{C}_1\) and show it cancels with the state equation‚Äôs contribution to \(\nabla^\mu T_{\mu\nu}\).

3. **First Parameter Bounds**  
   - Use existing experimental data (e.g., matter-wave interferometry) to estimate preliminary limits on \(|\lambda\xi|\).

Completion of these three will allow the framework to move from conceptual proposal to testable physics.
