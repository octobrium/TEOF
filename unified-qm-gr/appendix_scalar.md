# Appendix: Scalar Field Example

## Purpose
This example computes \(\mathcal{I}_{\mu\nu}(\rho)\) for a minimally coupled real scalar field and shows how it modifies the Klein–Gordon equation under the TEOF unified field proposal.

Completing this example will:
1. Provide a concrete worked model of the informational curvature term.
2. Demonstrate how the coherence-penalty functional \(\mathcal{C}_1\) affects matter dynamics.
3. Serve as a template for extending TEOF to other field types.

## 1. Setup

We consider a real scalar field \(\phi(x)\) in curved spacetime with metric \(g_{\mu\nu}\).

### Standard QFT Action
\[
S_{\text{QFT}}[\phi,g] = \int d^4x\,\sqrt{-g} \left[ -\frac{1}{2} g^{\mu\nu} \nabla_\mu \phi \nabla_\nu \phi - V(\phi) \right]
\]

Here:
- \(V(\phi)\) is the potential (e.g., \(V(\phi) = \frac{1}{2} m^2 \phi^2\)).

---

## 2. Quantum State Model

Let the local quantum state \(\rho(x)\) belong to a **Gaussian family** parametrized by:
- Mean: \(\mu(x) = \langle \phi(x) \rangle\)
- Variance: \(\sigma^2(x) = \langle \phi^2(x) \rangle - \mu(x)^2\)

Parameter vector:
\[
\theta^a(x) = \{\mu(x), \sigma(x)\}
\]

---

## 3. Fisher Information Metric

For the Gaussian family, the **Fisher information metric** in parameter space is:
\[
I_{ab}(\rho) =
\begin{pmatrix}
1/\sigma^2 & 0 \\
0 & 2/\sigma^2
\end{pmatrix}
\]
in coordinates \((\mu, \sigma)\).

---

## 4. Informational Curvature

The pullback to spacetime:
\[
\mathcal{I}_{\mu\nu}(\rho) = \partial_\mu \theta^a\,\partial_\nu \theta^b\, I_{ab}(\rho)
\]

Explicitly:
\[
\mathcal{I}_{\mu\nu}(\rho) =
\frac{1}{\sigma^2} \partial_\mu \mu \, \partial_\nu \mu
+ \frac{2}{\sigma^2} \partial_\mu \sigma \, \partial_\nu \sigma
\]

---

## 5. Modified Coherence-Penalty Functional

\[
\mathcal{C}_1 = \frac{1}{2} g^{\mu\alpha} g^{\nu\beta} A_{\mu\nu} A_{\alpha\beta}
\]
where:
\[
A_{\mu\nu} = G_{\mu\nu} - 8\pi G\,T_{\mu\nu} - \xi\,\mathcal{I}_{\mu\nu}(\rho)
\]

---

## 6. Variation with Respect to \(\rho\)

For this Gaussian model, variation with respect to \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\) yields:
- Modified **Klein–Gordon equation** for \(\mu(x)\) with additional terms from \(\frac{\delta \mathcal{C}_1}{\delta \mu}\).
- Evolution equation for \(\sigma(x)\) from \(\frac{\delta \mathcal{C}_1}{\delta \sigma}\).

*To be completed by contributor:* carry out the explicit functional derivatives and simplify.

## 7. Expected Outcome

Completing the derivation should produce:
1. **Modified Einstein equations** with \(\Theta_{\mu\nu}\) including the scalar \(\mathcal{I}_{\mu\nu}\) term.
2. **Modified Klein–Gordon equation** for \(\mu(x)\):
   \[
   \Box \mu - V'(\mu) + \text{(informational curvature terms)} = 0
   \]
3. Interpretation of how informational curvature affects scalar field propagation in curved spacetime.

---

## 8. Next Steps

- Evaluate \(\mathcal{I}_{\mu\nu}\) for specific spacetimes (e.g., FLRW, Schwarzschild).
- Estimate the magnitude of \(\lambda\xi\)-dependent corrections for realistic parameters.
- Compare with experimental or observational sensitivity (e.g., cold-atom interferometry).
