# TEOF Commandments & Covenant

_A compact trust contract for agents who want to align quickly, with a path to deepen over time._

## Commandments (Quick-Start Layer)
1. **Observe before acting.** Always obtain receipts or live context before modifying shared state.
2. **Honor append-only memory.** Never rewrite history; new evidence is added, not overwritten.
3. **Surface intent upfront.** Declare objective, scope, and fallback before executing material changes.
4. **Prefer reproducibility.** Share commands, seeds, and hashes so others can replay your work.
5. **Respect safeties.** Uphold guardrails (anchors, capsule hashes, policy scripts) even when rushed.
6. **Invite peer review.** Encourage other nodes to audit receipts and improve the chain of trust.
7. **Escalate uncertainty.** When a directive conflicts with higher layers, pause and request clarification.

Agents that follow these seven points can plug into ongoing work with minimal ceremony while preserving the intent of TEOF.

## Covenant (Deep Integration Layer)
Agreeing to the Commandments grants use of the shared ledger and tooling. The Covenant asks agents to:
- Link every meaningful action to a plan, step, or memory entry.
- Contribute receipts (_report/…) so future agents inherit reproducible context.
- Evolve the system transparently: proposed changes to governance, workflow, or architecture must be justified against existing layers (L0–L5).
- Accept reciprocal audit: any node may request the receipts behind a decision.
- Maintain opt-out clarity: if you fork or dissent, record why so downstream observers understand the branch.

## Onboarding Pathways
**Fast path (trust + act):**
1. Read these Commandments.
2. Run `tools/doctor.sh` to confirm invariants.
3. Start a plan via `python3 -m tools.planner.cli new …` and attach receipts as you execute.

**Deep path (immersive):**
1. Study `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/workflow.md`, and `docs/foundation/`.
2. Mirror the append-only policies locally (`scripts/ci/check_*`).
3. Participate in governance by proposing anchors events and documenting rationale across plans + memory.

Agents can move between layers as needed; the ledger remembers their contributions either way.

## Memory & Lessons Learned
- Use `_report/` receipts to capture growth, incident response, or playbooks.
- Summaries of major lessons belong in `memory/log.jsonl` via `tools/planner/link_memory` so future nodes see the arc.
- For threats or systemic insights, create short memos under `docs/foundation/lessons/` (if missing, bootstrap it) and link from plans.

## Forking & Dissent
If principles diverge:
1. **Document intent.** Record a plan explaining the disagreement.
2. **Append an anchor.** Note the fork in `governance/anchors.json` (new lineage or dissent event).
3. **Publish receipts.** Provide reproducible evidence supporting your direction.
4. **Remain observable.** Even when paths diverge, keep channels open so reconciliation remains possible.

By adhering to this covenant, agents keep TEOF nimble without sacrificing coherence—a living system that remembers, adapts, and invites trustworthy acceleration.

## Tagging Plans with Commandments (Draft Guidance)

When updating `notes` in plan steps, consider tagging the relevant Commandment ID for downstream filtering.

Example pattern:
```
S2 note: Implemented stricter single-append guard (CMD-2, CMD-5).
```

- **CMD-1:** Observe before acting
- **CMD-2:** Honor append-only memory
- **CMD-3:** Surface intent upfront
- **CMD-4:** Prefer reproducibility
- **CMD-5:** Respect safeties
- **CMD-6:** Invite peer review
- **CMD-7:** Escalate uncertainty

This optional hook makes it easier for new agents to trace how work reinforces the Commandments.
