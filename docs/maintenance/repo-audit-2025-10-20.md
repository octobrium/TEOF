# Repository Audit â€” 2025-10-20

**Author:** codex-5

## Scope

Full sweep of TEOF after backlog compaction and receipts hygiene upgrades. Focused on:

- Pending backlog hygiene items (ND-061 .. ND-067) and recent shipments.
- Receipts growth under `_report/usage/` (index, autonomy audit, hygiene).
- Plan/library health in `tools/agent`, `tools/autonomy`, and supporting docs/tests.

Artifacts reviewed via `git ls-tree`, targeted `find`, and sampling of receipts/automation docs.

## Findings

### Backlog / Plans
- `_plans/next-development.todo.json` now holds 16 active pending items with matching `systemic_targets`/`layer_targets`. Archived completions moved to `_plans/next-development.archive.json` (40 entries) with canonical receipts.
- Backlog compaction plan (`_plans/2025-10-20-backlog-compaction.plan.json`) marked complete, referencing planner validation receipts. Breakdown aligns with ND-061.
- Autonomy audit aggregation plan (`_plans/2025-10-20-autonomy-audit-aggregation.plan.json`) closed with receipts pointing to manifest + pytest outputs.

### Receipts footprint
- `_report/usage/` retains structured state:
  - `receipts-index/manifest.json` plus chunked dirs (<=500 entries per chunk). Manifest includes summary + chunk references.
  - `receipts-index-latest.jsonl` downgraded to pointer (summary + manifest reference).
  - `receipts-latency-latest.jsonl` continues to mirror plan latencies.
  - `_report/usage/autonomy-audit/summary-latest.json` holds aggregated stats; historical receipts reside under `archive/<stamp>` with matching `manifest.json` receipts.
- `_report/planner/validate/` populated with timestamped summaries (e.g., `summary-20251020T090040Z.json`). All recent validation passes recorded.

### Tooling health
- `tools/agent` scripts (receipts_index, receipts_hygiene, manager_report, session_brief) updated to use manifest-based index; tests cover new workflow (`tests/test_receipts_index.py`, `tests/test_receipts_hygiene.py`, `tests/test_session_brief.py`).
- `tools/autonomy/autonomy_audit_digest.py` provides digest CLI; aggregated receipts appended to repo with test coverage (`tests/test_autonomy_audit_digest.py`).
- `.gitignore` allows `_report/usage/autonomy-audit/archive/**` so manifests land in Git; no new holes.

### Documentation
- Docs (`docs/automation.md`, `docs/ci-guarantees.md`, `docs/usage/direction-metrics.md`, `docs/automation/autonomy-audit-digest.md`) reflect manifest workflow + autonomy audit retention rules.

### Potential improvements
1. **Archive compression:** archived autonomy audit receipts remain individual JSON files. Consider zipping each stamp directory for storage efficiency while keeping manifest intact.
2. **Index chunk size tuning:** `--chunk-size` defaults to 500. Monitor repo growth; add guidance for alternative chunk sizes in docs.
3. **Receipts pointers:** pointer file still includes inline summary entries. Evaluate trimming or adding manifest-only mode to reduce duplication.
4. **Automation integration:** ensure autonomy loops call `autonomy_audit_digest` and `receipts_hygiene` on cadence (watch `_report/usage/autonomy-audit/summary-latest.json` freshness).

## Summary

- Top-level repo structure remains aligned with `docs/architecture.md`. Append-only archives are in `_plans/next-development.archive.json` and `_report/usage/autonomy-audit/archive/**`.
- Receipts and index surfaces are intentional and referenced by plans + docs. Tests cover the new guardrails.
- No disorganized or vestigial artifacts detected. huidige state consistent with ND-061/ND-062 outcomes.
