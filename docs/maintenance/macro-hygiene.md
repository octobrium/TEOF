# Macro Hygiene Objectives — 2025-09-18
- Stabilize environment hygiene: provide a consistent manifest/branch swap helper so AGENT_MANIFEST.json and tooling directories don’t stay dirty across sessions.
- Integrate new helpers/tests into CI: ensure prune helper, consensus CLIs, and manager heartbeat guards run in guardrails or dedicated jobs.
- Align capsule cadence: map outstanding governance/consensus work to the next capsule freeze, plan anchors.json updates, and document the target release.
- Clarify auto-progression triggers: document when agents may proceed without manager re-approval after claiming tasks so coordination scales without unnecessary check-ins.
