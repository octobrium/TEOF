# Relay Insight Sprint — Collateral Kit (2025-09-26)

## Landing Page Copy
- **Headline:** "Decide faster with receipts." 48-hour strategy sprints powered by
  the guarded Relay loop.
- **Sub-head:** We ingest your questions, run the autonomy conductor under strict
  guardrails, and deliver a cite-backed brief you can defend in boardrooms.
- **Proof points:**
  - Deterministic prompts + receipts (`docs/automation/autonomy-conductor.md`).
  - OCERS scoring + objective ledger snapshots (`teof-objectives-status`).
  - Guarded API relay with human-in-the-loop approval (`docs/vision/relay-offering.md`).
- **Call-to-action:** "Book a pilot sprint" → embeds intake form (see below).

## Intake Form (Notion / Typeform draft)
1. **Focus question(s):** up to three prompts you need resolved.
2. **Decision context:** who needs this answer and by when?
3. **Existing material:** links to decks, memos, transcripts.
4. **Risk appetite:** confirm the autonomy guardrails (diff/test caps, consent).
5. **Preferred deliverable format:** PDF, Notion, Markdown.
6. **Contact + billing:** name, email, company, approval for Tier A ($250) or
   Tier B ($500) pricing.
7. **Audit consent:** checkbox acknowledging that all prompts + receipts will be
   shared post-sprint.

## Outreach Script
> Subject: 48-hour research sprint with receipts
>
> Hi <Name>,
>
> We're piloting the **Relay Insight Sprint** – a 48-hour research + strategy
> loop that ships a cite-backed brief and command log you can audit. Every action
> runs through the TEOF autonomy conductor (diff/test guardrails, authenticity
> checks) so you get speed *and* trust.
>
> I'd love to run a pilot on <focus area>. Tier A is $250 (single question),
> Tier B is $500 (up to three questions + review call). If you're interested,
> reply with your questions or book directly via <link>.
>
> Receipts + sample brief attached.
