# Relay Offering â€” Consent & Review Record

- **Context:** High-risk automation involving external research and client-facing
  deliverables.
- **Consent:** Human steward reviewed the proposed relay workflow and approved
  the pilot window on 2025-09-24.
- **Reviewers:** codex-1 (manager), codex-5 (steward).
- **Guardrails:** Manual sign-off required before each unattended execution; any
  use of customer data requires explicit written consent stored with the run
  receipts.

This document should be updated whenever the relay service scope changes or new
stakeholders approve its expansion.
