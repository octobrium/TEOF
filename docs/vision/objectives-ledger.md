# Objectives Ledger (L2) — 2025-09-23

Linking TEOF’s autonomy work to personal mission. Each objective inherits from
L0 observations and L1 principles.

## O1 — Preserve Life Alignment Narrative
- **Outcome:** every reflection that shapes policy or backlog records its source
  and layer, maintaining a traceable mirror of lived experience.
- **Metric:** ≥ 1 curated reflection per week with associated receipts and
  backlog review.
- **Signals:** `memory/reflections/`, `_plans/next-development.todo.json`.
 - **Status Tool:** `teof-objectives-status` (O1 counter).

## O2 — Demonstrate Trustworthy Autonomy in Cyberspace
- **Outcome:** unattended runs (conductor/auto_loop) remain auditably aligned
  and deliver tangible outputs (receipts, docs, artifacts).
- **Metric:** at least one guardrail-compliant autonomy cycle per week with
  diff/test enforcement and recorded receipts.
- **Signals:** `_report/usage/autonomy-conductor/`, `_report/usage/autonomy-actions/`.
 - **Status Tool:** `teof-objectives-status` (O2 counter).

## O3 — Build Shared Mental Model (Unity)
- **Outcome:** collaborators can onboard, understand TEOF’s intent, and monitor
  health without private context.
- **Metric:** roadmap + onboarding playbook available and referenced in
  automation receipts; partner reviews acknowledge clarity.
- **Signals:** `docs/vision/`, `docs/automation/`, `_report/usage/` dashboards.

## O4 — Real-World Impact Feedback Loop
- **Outcome:** link repository progress to concrete external wins (decisions,
  content, or relationships).
- **Metric:** log >0 external outcomes per quarter with receipts pointing to the
  supporting autonomy runs or reflections.
- **Signals:** `memory/log.jsonl`, `_report/usage/chronicle/` entries.
 - **Ledger:** `docs/vision/impact-ledger.md` (records outcomes + value).

## O5 — Guardrail Integrity
- **Outcome:** authenticity, CI, and diff/test policies stay green; deviations
  trigger automated escalations and human review.
- **Metric:** zero unattended runs bypassing consent or failing authenticity
  thresholds; all incidents produce remediation receipts.
- **Signals:** `_report/usage/external-authenticity.*`, `_report/usage/autonomy-status.json`.
 - **Status Tool:** `teof-objectives-status` (O5 summary).

## O6 — Cooperative Cadence
- **Outcome:** multiple neurons (humans/LLMs) contribute within the same weeks,
  sharing conductor prompts, reflections, and receipts without drift.
- **Metric:** ≥ 2 distinct contributors (human or agent identities) logged per
  fortnight with linked backlog entries and conductor receipts.
- **Signals:** `_bus/`, `_report/usage/autonomy-conductor/`,
  `docs/automation/conductor-agent-pilot.md` outcomes.

## O7 — External Sensing & Feedback
- **Outcome:** TEOF continuously ingests and reacts to outside signals (public
  artifacts, partner input, environment metrics) so alignment remains grounded
  beyond the repo.
- **Metric:** ≥ 1 external dataset or partner feedback receipt refreshed monthly
  with documented impact on backlog or objectives.
- **Signals:** `_report/usage/external-*`, `memory/log.jsonl`, external artifact
  directories.
 - **Status Tool:** `teof-objectives-status` (O7 freshness).
