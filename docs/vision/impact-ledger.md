# Impact Ledger (O4)

Documenting real-world outcomes attributable to TEOF activity. Each entry links
to supporting receipts (prompts, reflections, artifacts) so success can be
audited.

## Template
```
Date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
Outcome: <What happened (e.g., published article, closed deal)>
Value: <Quantified impact (revenue, hours saved, opportunity created)>
Receipts:
  - <memory/reflections/...>
  - <_report/...>
Notes: <Context, lessons learned>
```

Record raw entries with `teof-impact-log --title ...` (writes to
`memory/impact/log.jsonl`); summarize key wins here for storytelling.

## Example Entries

- *2025-09-23 — API Relay Dry-Run Pilot*
  - Outcome: Guarded conduit for external agent responses.
  - Value: Enables future monetization via automated research/drafting.
  - Receipts: `_report/usage/autonomy-conductor/api-relay/relay-conductor-20250923T204918Z.json`, `memory/reflections/reflection-20250923T205003Z.json`.
  - Notes: Dry-run only; follow-up to enable live calls and monetizable outputs.
- *2025-09-26 — Objectives Instrumentation for Relay Insight Sprint*
  - Outcome: Ledger + conductor receipts now capture coordination docs, impact cadence, and multi-agent participation so sales collateral can cite deterministic guardrails.
  - Value: Pre-revenue (unlocking Tier A/B pricing conversations).
  - Receipts: `tools/autonomy/objectives_status.py`, `tools/autonomy/conductor.py`, `docs/vision/objectives-ledger.md`, `docs/automation/autonomy-conductor.md`.
  - Notes: Enables quoting prospects with concrete guardrail evidence ahead of the Relay Insight Sprint pilot.
