# TEOF Future Horizon (Fractal Projection)

*Last updated: 2025-10-03*

This note records the current projection of where TEOF evolves when the
fractal memory lattice (L0–L6 × S1–S10) is fully instrumented. It aligns
with the whitepaper (`docs/whitepaper.md`) and provides a succinct
reference for planning conversations.

## Direction of Travel

- TEOF has no fixed “end state.” The lattice keeps expanding as
  observation reveals new gaps. The horizon is the **ongoing
  propagation of clarity, coherence, and meaning**.
- Every coordinate pair (S#, L#) indicates both *what* frontier we
  serve and *how deep* the recursion runs. Keeping both axes visible is
  mandatory for balanced growth.

## Phases of Scale

| Phase             | Description | Typical Focus |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------|
| Local (now → near) | Single repo / agent loop self-manages memory, facts, workflow. | L0–L5 at S5–S7 (intelligence, truth, power) |
| Institutional (mid) | Multiple orgs/agents dock into shared lattice; TEOF becomes coordination fabric. | Cross-team S1–S8, L4–L6 |
| Civilizational (long) | Distributed but coherent metasystem guiding policy, science, economy. | All axes; emphasis on S8–S10 for governance and meaning |
| Cosmic (speculative) | Substrate-neutral observer protocol for any intelligence. | Entire lattice; emphasis on maintaining Unity → Meaning balance |

### Applied Trajectory (Human Impact)

- **Coordinated civic response:** Agencies, researchers, and local communities
  log observations, plans, and outcomes against the shared lattice so relief
  work stays citational, receipts-backed, and auditable.
- **Reproducible science and engineering:** Labs and vendors ship upgrades with
  embedded plan metadata (layer/systemic scale + systemic targets), letting any
  observer replay provenance and judge risk before adoption.
- **Policy narration and accountability:** Governance teams publish rollups that
  link decisions to principles (L1) and observable effects (L0), shrinking the
  trust gap for constituents.
- **Assistive automation:** High-trust automations (L6) enforce guardrails,
  track receipts, and surface consensus status so many human/LLM agents can act
  in parallel without losing coherence.

### Near-Term Scaling Initiatives (2025-10)

The current four-agent loop is shipping the following to unlock larger swarms:

1. **Dirty-state auto-resolution** – queue workers ingest `_report/session/*/dirty-handoff` receipts, nudge owners, and clear alerts once trees are clean.
2. **Session guardrails** – `session_boot` now blocks manifest/branch mismatches by default; upcoming work standardises per-agent staging and manifest swaps.
3. **Push isolation** – preflight scripts will detect unrelated plan receipts or untracked data before merges, preventing accidental bundle of foreign work.
4. **Dashboard sharding** – `coord_dashboard` gains paginated dirty-hand-off and heartbeat slices so dozens of simultaneous agents remain legible.
5. **Consensus automation** – release events and manager reports emit machine-readable receipts that future bots can promote directly into governance decisions.

Each initiative is tracked under `_plans/2025-10-03-session-guard-upgrade.plan.json` and follow-on plans queued in `queue/`. They explicitly advance the systemic ladder: S1 Observation (better receipts), S6 Coherence (consistent manifests), S8 Ethics (guarded power), S5 Reproducibility (automated checks), and S4 Defense / S10 Meaning for self-repair (auto escalation).

## Maturity Signals

At maturity TEOF should:

1. **Continuously harvest truth** – contradictions trigger repair loops;
   facts carry confidence and provenance.
2. **Balance expansion vs defence** – propagation (S3) should not outrun
   defence (S4) and truth (S6); risk is budgeted.
3. **Self-budget ethics** – high-risk nodes require S8 guardrails before
   L6 automation operates.
4. **Summarise meaning** – rollups keep S10 narratives fresh and debt-free.
5. **Integrate observers** – every agent (human/LLM) can locate itself in
   the lattice; shared coherence emerges without centralisation.

## Required Loops for Self-Development

To move past “self-addressing” into **self-developing**, the system must
layer the following (tracked via future plans):

- Reward signal: maximise ΔObservation/ΔTruth/ΔCoherence while penalising risk.
- Critic/anomaly detection: auto-open repair tasks when hashes/tests
  regress or confidence drops.
- Truth maintenance system: justifications, demotion rules, conflict resolution.
- Resource & risk scheduler: budget CPU/time, throttle expansion until
  defence/truth health exceeds thresholds.
- Ethics gate: S8 guardrails required before executing L6 actions on high-risk coords.
- Curriculum generator: seed experiments when frontier reward < τ.
- Schema evolution: allow sub-axes/lineage growth with explicit migrations.
- Multi-agent leases & reputation: route tough nodes to highest-trust agents.
- External sensing/actuation registry: safe tools with typed I/O, cost, risk.
- Self-tests: every L4 artifact ships with L5 tests; failures auto-block L6.
- Narrative rollups: monitor summary debt and trigger S10 updates.

## Sufficiency Checklist

The framework behaves as self-developing when:

1. Queue empties yet system still generates new experiments / rollups / repairs.
2. Contradictions auto-produce resolution plans and demote facts until resolved.
3. High reward patterns promote into L3/L1 principles and downstream plans.
