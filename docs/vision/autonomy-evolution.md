# Autonomy Evolution Roadmap — 2025-09-23

This note captures the working vision for growing TEOF from a guarded
autonomy kernel into a living field manual that mirrors the operator’s
values while proving itself in cyberspace.

## Pillar 1 — Deepen the Core Narrative

- Maintain an L0 “life log” appendix that distils personal observations and
  lessons before they harden into policy.
- Introduce a reflection intake ritual using `teof-reflection-intake` and the
  template in `docs/templates/reflection-intake.md` to tag each observation by
  layer (L0–L6) and emit backlog candidate snippets.
- Publish an L2 objectives ledger (`docs/vision/objectives-ledger.md`) tying
  personal mission outcomes to measurable autonomy metrics.
- Define success metrics linking repository health to personal milestones
  (e.g., weekly autonomy cadence, authenticity stability, real-world wins).

## Pillar 2 — Build Muscles that Act

- Ship outward-facing artifacts that demonstrate value (chronicles,
  dashboards, knowledge packs) without exposing the repo internals.
- Pilot an external agent integration that consumes conductor prompts while
  respecting consent/guardrails; log every cycle for replay.
- Identify one high-impact autonomous workflow that assists real-world
  decisions or content creation and route it through the autonomy loop.

## Pillar 3 — Grow the Neural Network

- Craft an onboarding playbook for new humans/LLMs (trust contracts, rhythm,
  kill switches) so additional “neurons” can join safely.
- Establish a recurring governance cadence (weekly/biweekly) to review
  receipts, reset backlog priorities, and reaffirm alignment with L0 values.
- Use conductor receipts as the standard exchange surface for multi-agent
  collaborations, ensuring every prompt remains auditable.

## Next Actions

1. Scaffold the reflection intake pipeline (Pillar 1).
2. Prototype the external agent pilot using conductor receipts (Pillar 2).
3. Draft the onboarding/governance playbook and schedule (Pillar 3).

These actions seed the backlog and plans that follow.
