# OCERS ↔ Systemic Hierarchy Mapping (Draft)

The OCERS loop is a diagnostic overlay. Each phase maps to one or more systemic
axes (S1–S10). This draft mapping will evolve as governance refines the
relationship.

| OCERS Phase | Primary Systemic Axes | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Observation | S1 Unity, S2 Energy | Establish shared reference frames and capture raw signals. |
| Coherence | S3 Propagation, S6 Truth | Keep signals consistent across nodes and aligned with invariants. |
| Ethics | S8 Ethics | Governs use of power; inherits constraints from foundational axes. |
| Reproducibility | S5 Intelligence, S6 Truth | Ensure processes can be replayed and inspected. |
| Self-repair | S4 Defense, S10 Meaning | Detect contradictions, protect coherence, and adjust narratives. |

**Adaptation window:** This mapping is provisional. As we analyse more
observations, we may shift or expand the associations (e.g., Reproducibility may
link into S9 Freedom when variability is required). Updates will be logged
through plan `2025-10-06-ocers-systemic-alignment` or successors.
