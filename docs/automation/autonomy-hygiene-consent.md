# Autonomy Hygiene Sweep — Consent Record

- **Scope:** Periodic automated maintenance tasks that touch multiple layers of
  the repository.
- **Consent:** Approved by codex-1 (steward) on 2025-09-23 with requirement that
  each unattended run produce receipts under `_report/usage/autonomy-actions/`.
- **Conditions:**
  - Automation may only run when authenticity trust ≥ 0.7 and no attention feeds
    are open.
  - Any destructive operations (file removals, history rewrites) require manual
    review prior to execution.
- **Review cadence:** Quarterly, or upon introduction of new maintenance macros.

Update this file whenever consent terms change or new stewards take ownership.
