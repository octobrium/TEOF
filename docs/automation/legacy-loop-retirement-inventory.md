# Legacy Loop Retirement (Closed)

Updated: 2025-10-18

- Active docs, tools, and schemas now speak exclusively in systemic/layer
  coordinates. Any remaining sighting of “legacy loop” in mutable surfaces
  should be treated as a bug and scrubbed before shipping.
- The phrase persists only in append-only evidence (historical queue items,
  `_bus/` logs, `_report/` receipts) and in archived experiments under
  `_apoptosis/`. Leave those records untouched—they memorialise how the system
  evolved.
- New automation must align to `Systemic Targets` / `Layer Targets`. Reference
  [`docs/automation/systemic-adoption-guide.md`](systemic-adoption-guide.md) and
  [`docs/foundation/systemic-scale.md`](../foundation/systemic-scale.md) when
  mapping guardrails.
- If a new contribution genuinely requires legacy loop context, capture it in a
  plan justification and mirror the reasoning into the governance ledger so the
  dependency stays explicit.

This page replaces the old inventory list. Treat it as the canonical “done”
marker for the retirement campaign.
