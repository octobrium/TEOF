# OCERS Retirement Progress Log

## Implemented migrations
- Replaced each `queue/*.md` `OCERS Target` block with explicit `Systemic Targets` and `Layer Targets` headers.
- Seeded all `_plans/*.plan.json` with explicit `systemic_targets` and `layer_targets` arrays derived from their existing OCERS vectors, systemic scale, and layer fields.
- Purged `ocers_target` fields from live plans and regenerated migration receipts.
- Extended `tools/planner/systemic_targets.py` keyword map so safety, evidence, outreach, impact, and throughput metadata translate into S-axis tokens.
- Hardened planner validation/tests to require well-formed systemic/layer targets and reject legacy `ocers_target` fields.
- Updated queue template checks, planner CLI/tests, backlog tooling, and advisory generators to consume the new metadata.
- Test coverage: `pytest tests/test_planner_cli.py tests/test_planner_validation.py` passes with the new schema enforcement.
- Planner receipt: rerun `python3 -m tools.planner.validate --strict` after staging updated documentation so the new receipts register as tracked.

## Next steps
- Finish swapping observational/reporting dashboards (e.g., autonomy health, conformance summaries) to render systemic/layer coverage exclusively.
- Archive remaining OCERS reference docs or annotate them as historical context.
