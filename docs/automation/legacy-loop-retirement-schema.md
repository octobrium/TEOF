# retired observation loop Retirement – Replacement Schema Draft

Generated on 2025-10-16 by codex-2 for plan `2025-10-16-systemic-retirement` (step **S2**).
This document specifies how we will replace retired observation loop terminology with explicit
Systemic/Layer coordinates across documentation, metadata, and automation.

## 1. Coordinate Principles

- **Systemic axis (S1–S10)** captures *why* the work matters (Unity → Meaning).
- **Layer axis (L0–L6)** captures *how* the work is performed
  (Observation → Automation).
- Every artifact MUST expose the pair `(systemic_targets, layer_targets)` so
  humans and automation can triangulate intent without translating retired observation loop.
- When legacy retired observation loop vectors appear, map them using the tables below and record
  both the systemic priority and the layer of execution. Mixed retired observation loop phases
  often compress into a single systemic target; decompose as needed.

## 2. retired observation loop → Systemic/Layer Mapping

| retired observation loop Phase      | Primary Systemic Axes | Typical Layer Focus | Migration Notes |
| ---              | ---                   | ---                 | --- |
| Observation      | S1 Unity, S2 Energy   | L0–L2               | Already present in `Observation trigger` fields; ensure receipts cite S1/S2 explicitly. |
| Coherence        | S3 Propagation, S6 Truth | L3–L5            | Use `systemic_targets: ["S3", "S6"]` and record exact layer (e.g., `L4`). |
| Ethics           | S4 Defense, S6 Truth, S8 Ethics | L4–L5      | Guardrails MUST list prerequisite axes (`["S4","S6"]`) before `S8`. |
| Reproducibility  | S5 Intelligence, S6 Truth | L3–L6          | Replace “Reproducibility↑” with `systemic_targets: ["S5","S6"]`; automation receipts stay under L6. |
| Self-repair      | S4 Defense, S10 Meaning | L5–L6           | Encode escalation flows as `S4` guards that evolve into `S10` once recovery succeeds. |

When an retired observation loop phrase implied multiple axes (e.g., “Coherence↑ Safety↑”), split
it into `systemic_targets` with priority ordering. Use the ordering rule from
`docs/foundation/systemic-scale.md`—higher axes MUST appear first if all are
being targeted simultaneously.

## 3. Metadata Specification

To retire `legacy_loop_target` fields, introduce the following replacements.

### 3.1 Plans (`_plans/*.plan.json`)

```jsonc
{
  "systemic_targets": ["S6", "S4"],
  "layer_targets": ["L4"],
  "systemic_scale": 6,
  "layer": "L4"
}
```

- `systemic_targets`: ordered list (highest priority first) of S-axis tokens.
- `layer_targets`: ordered list of L-axis tokens touched by the plan; defaults
  to the existing `layer` value if omitted.
- `systemic_scale`: single primary axis expressing the checkpoint (integer `1–10`,
  kept for backwards compatibility with existing receipts).
- **Removal:** delete `legacy_loop_target` once the new fields are populated. *(Completed in experimental branch on 2025-10-16; the planner CLI no longer accepts `--legacy-loop-target` and validators reject the field.)*
- **Validation:** extend `tools/planner/cli.py` and `tools/planner/validate.py`
  to require that every plan with `systemic_targets` also includes matching
  `layer_targets`. Fallback for legacy plans: emit warnings until step S3 flips
  the check to hard errors.

### 3.2 Queue Entries (`queue/*.md`)

Replace the `retired observation loop Target` block with:

```
Systemic Targets: S3 Propagation, S6 Truth
Layer Targets: L5 Workflow
```

- If multiple systemic axes apply, separate with commas and keep priority order.
- For artifacts that previously used “Evidence↑”, map to `S6 Truth` and ensure
  the surrounding text explains what counts as evidence receipts.

### 3.3 Automation & CLI

| Surface | retired observation loop usage today | Replacement design |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `teof scan` summary (`docs/automation.md`) | Displays retired observation loop tallies | Replace table with per-axis counters (`S#`) and per-layer saturation; add `--legacy-loop` flag to keep backwards compatibility until S3 completes. |
| `extensions/validator` receipts | Accept `retired observation loop` enums | Add schema fields `systemic_targets`/`layer_targets`; validator should reject retired observation loop keys once migration finalizes. |
| `scripts/ci/check_queue_template.py` | Checks for `retired observation loop Target` header | Update template to enforce the new headers and ensure comma-separated tokens parse. |

### 3.4 Reporting (`_report/**`)

- Update report generators to summarise work by `systemic_targets` and `layer_targets`.
- Historical retired observation loop references inside archived runs remain untouched; mark them
  as legacy in inventory notes to avoid over-migration.

## 4. Execution Roadmap (Step S3 Preview)

1. **Validator updates** – teach planner and CI tools to enforce the new fields.
2. **Bulk doc edits** – apply scripted replacements for queue and plan records,
   ensuring ordering rules and token formats match the spec.
3. **Automation surfaces** – change CLI output, tests, and dashboards to report
   by systemic/layer axes.
4. **Cleanup** – once tooling accepts the new fields everywhere, remove the
   `--legacy-loop` shims.

## 5. Receipts & Next Actions

- This schema is the receipt for plan step `S2` (“Design replacement schema”).
- Implementation details now feed step `S3` (“Implement and validate migration”).
- Update `_plans/2025-10-16-systemic-retirement.plan.json` to mark `S2` as `done`
  with `docs/automation/legacy-loop-retirement-schema.md` listed as the supporting evidence.
