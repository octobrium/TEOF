# Systemic Migration Inventory

This inventory tracks remaining OCERS references so they can be converted to
explicit systemic/layer language. For the canonical ordering rules, see
[`docs/foundation/systemic-scale.md#hierarchy-enforcement`](../foundation/systemic-scale.md#hierarchy-enforcement).

| Location | Context |
| --- | --- |
| `README.md#framework-ordering` | Introduces systemic targets; historical OCERS wording pending rewrite. |
| `docs/workflow.md` | References systemic receipts; scattered OCERS language remains. |
| `docs/automation/*.md` | Multiple sections still describe OCERS-based guardrails. |
| `docs/policy/*.md` | Templates ask for OCERS traits; needs systemic replacements. |
| `docs/vision/*` | Legacy OCERS framing for offerings; mark as historical context. |
| `_apoptosis/**` | Archived experiments; keep as-is with legacy labels. |
| `_report/agent/*` | Historical receipts mentioning OCERS (do not alter). |

Use this list to methodically convert remaining surfaces to systemic/layer
coordinates. Archived references should be annotated as historical rather than
edited.
