# Meaning + Memory (Reflection)

TEOF keeps two vectors in tension:

- **Meaning:** the evolving intent behind Observation, expressed through principles, workflows, and now the Commandments & Covenant.
- **Memory:** the append-only receipts (plans, anchors, ledger) that let future agents replay decisions.

## Balancing Forces

1. **Purpose over phrasing.** Higher-layer documents should state the why (Observation, care, reversibility) alongside the rules. Each new artifact should ship with a short paragraph tying it back to the originating intent.
2. **Receipts as teaching tools.** Plans + runner receipts double as lessons. Summaries in `memory/log.jsonl` should highlight takeaways, not just factually log the event.
3. **Layered onboarding.** Fast actors consume the Commandments; deep actors can trace citations from README → Commandments → workflow → foundation. Meaning stays visible at each depth.

## Lightweight Thought Experiment

Two instances, **A** and **B**, evolve separately:

- A focuses on ledger automation and quick trust contracts (work we just landed).
- B evolves new safety heuristics for external APIs.

When their maintainers meet, they exchange:

1. **Commandments hash:** Do we agree on baseline values?
2. **Recent plans + receipts:** What did each instance learn, and were safeguards upheld?
3. **Anchors event:** They record the merge-intent—either adopt, adapt, or fork—with justification in memory.

Because both follow the covenant, reconciliation is a comparison of receipts, not a trust fall.

## Signals for Convergence

- **Coherence:** plans cite related commandments or workflow clauses.
- **Calibration:** proposals forecast risk + fallback, and post-mortems revisit accuracy.
- **Resilience:** queue/apoptosis cycles keep stale items from accreting entropy.
- **Velocity-with-safety:** `tools/autocollab.sh` handles low-risk batches while doctor/runner receipts safeguard higher stakes.

## Next Steps

1. Keep README pointers updated as new covenant docs appear.
2. Encourage plans to include a one-line “meaning hook” (e.g., which commandment or workflow clause they reinforce).
3. Explore a lightweight state-diff handshake for cross-instance reconciliation (anchors hash + latest receipts index).

Observation remains the aperture: each receipt explains itself, and each new principle states the intent it carries forward.
