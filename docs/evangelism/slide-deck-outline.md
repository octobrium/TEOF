# Slide Deck Outline — TEOF in 10 Minutes

Use this scaffold with your preferred presentation tool. Each slide cites live receipts so the audience can verify claims.

1. **Opening — Why Receipts Beat Promises**
   - Problem: automation without audit trails.
   - Evidence: authenticity snapshot with trust >= 0.76 (`_report/usage/autonomy-conductor/conductor-20250927T195724Z.json`).
2. **TEOF Kernel**
   - Layers L0–L6 overview.
   - Anchor: `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/concept.md` graphics.
3. **Guardrails in Action**
   - Show conductor prompt diff/test contract.
   - Evidence: `_report/usage/autonomy-conductor/conductor-20250927T195724Z.json` guardrails block.
4. **Coordination Dashboard**
   - Display latest coordination snapshot.
   - Evidence: `_report/agent/codex-4/2025-09-19-heartbeat-integration-codex4/coord-dashboard.json` and `docs/parallel-codex.md#coordination-dashboard`.
5. **Impact & Case Studies**
   - Relay case study prep and roadmap.
   - Evidence: `docs/impact/case-study-roadmap.md` and `_report/usage/case-study/relay-insight/` receipts.
6. **Call to Action**
   - Invite pilot or integration.
   - Next steps: `docs/evangelism/distribution-cadence.md`, `teof-objectives-status` demo, capsule request (`capsule/current/STATUS.md`).

Add appendices with quickstart commands, authenticity escalation history, and ledger excerpts if the audience needs deeper dives.
