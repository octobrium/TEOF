# Demo Video Script — 3 Minutes

**Goal:** Show a receipts-first autonomy loop from install to verifiable outcome.

## Scene 1 — Hook (0:00–0:30)
- Visual: dashboard of messy automation logs.
- Narration: "Automation fails when teams trust vibes. TEOF anchors every step to receipts."
- Cut to authenticity gauge hitting 0.76 (`_report/usage/autonomy-preflight/preflight-20250927T200419Z.json`).

## Scene 2 — Install & Brief (0:30–1:10)
- Command line: `python3 -m pip install -e .` then `teof brief`.
- Show `artifacts/ocers_out/latest/brief.json` opening with OCERS scores.
- Narration: "First run prints receipts so audit starts at minute one."

## Scene 3 — Conductor Prompt (1:10–1:50)
- Visual: highlight diff limit, tests, and receipts dir inside `_report/usage/autonomy-conductor/conductor-20250927T195724Z.json`.
- Narration: "Before autonomy touches the repo, it proves trust scores and guardrails."

## Scene 4 — Coordination Pulse (1:50–2:20)
- Visual: render summary from `_report/agent/codex-4/2025-09-19-heartbeat-integration-codex4/coord-dashboard.json`.
- Narration: "Every neuron shares the same situational awareness." 

## Scene 5 — Impact (2:20–2:50)
- Visual: overlay plan ND-018 and relay case receipts (`docs/impact/relay-insight-case-study.md`).
- Narration: "Stories land with receipts so partners can replay every decision."

## Scene 6 — Call to Action (2:50–3:00)
- Narration: "Invite us to run a guarded sprint. You keep the receipts."
