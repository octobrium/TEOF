# Macro Hygiene Objectives Integration

## Summary
Track macro hygiene commitments with durable receipts and surface their status across autonomy dashboards. Ensure the OCERS view stays trustworthy as macro hygiene objectives evolve.

## Context
- ND-041 remains the top-ranked backlog item for weaving macro hygiene checks into autonomy reporting.
- Plan `2025-10-07-macro-hygiene-objectives` is active and captures the execution steps.

## Next Steps
1. Instrument receipts/dashboards defined in the active plan.
2. Update autonomy status docs once instrumentation lands.
3. Close the plan and archive this idea after receipts verify macro hygiene coverage.
