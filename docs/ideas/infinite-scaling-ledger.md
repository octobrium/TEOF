# Infinite Scaling Ledger for TEOF

Design an append-only, hash-linked receipt protocol so TEOF nodes can contribute compute without congestion, similar to Bitcoin’s block chain. Each node would:

- Pull tasks and plans from the canonical repo.
- Generate receipts that reference the previous hash and include signatures from keys in `governance/anchors.json`.
- Broadcast receipt availability via the bus or an external mirror.
- Rely on validators (CI or dedicated agents) to replay and accept valid receipts, rejecting malformed ones.

## Questions
- How to shard receipts (per plan, per command) to avoid contention?
- What consensus rules do we enforce (format, plan existence, duplicate detection)?
- Which hosts store the canonical hash chain—on GitHub, separate receipt ledger, or both?

## Next Steps
1. Prototype a hash-linked receipt format using existing `_report/usage/` flow.
2. Define validator logic and integrate into CI (`scripts/ci/*`).
3. Explore external receipt mirrors for high-volume nodes while anchoring hashes back into GitHub.
