# Proposals

This directory holds human-readable proposals (drafts or adopted). Each file should include:

- Metadata block (`title`, `batch`, `item`, `generated`, OCERS rationale)
- Problem statement / motivation
- Proposed actions / acceptance criteria
- Sunset / fallback

**Process reminder:**
- When posting a proposal to `manager-report`, mirror it here (or reference an existing plan) so other codex can discover it without replaying the bus.
- After implementation, either mark the proposal as satisfied or cross-link to the relevant plan receipts.

Use the existing drafts as a pattern (`*_draft.md`).
