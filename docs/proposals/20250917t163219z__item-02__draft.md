# Proposal (draft)
# Task: Anchors append-only guard
Goal: Add a fast guard so new `governance/anchors.json` events must:
- append at the end (no mid-file edits),
- include `prev_content_hash`,
- have non-decreasing `ts`.
Systemic rationale:
- **S4 Defense / S6 Truth** — protect append-only lineage and verifiable anchors.
- **L4 Architecture / L5 Workflow** — keep governance rules enforceable in guardrails.
Sunset: Remove if it creates false positives >5% of PRs for two weeks.
Fallback: Keep warn-only in doctor and manual review of anchors.
Acceptance: `tools/doctor.sh` shows no ❌ for valid append; fails on mid-file edits.
