# Proposal (draft)
# Task: systemic scorer v0.2 (weights + simple signals)
Goal: Replace binary stub with weighted signals (e.g., presence of sunset/fallback, references, determinism).
Systemic rationale:
- **S4 Defense** — guardrails catch risky proposals earlier.
- **S5 Intelligence** — richer signals improve recursive evaluation.
- **S6 Truth** — strengthens evidence scoring.
Sunset: Revert if mis-scores >20% on sampled human labels.
Fallback: Use current stub.
Acceptance (historical): legacy evaluator emitted per-dimension subscores and a weighted total.  
> **Note:** systemic heuristics now live under `teof/eval/systemic_min.py`; retain this draft for archival context only.
