# Proposal (draft)
# Task: Tighten anchors.json policy
Goal: add a guard so new anchor events must append at end with `prev_content_hash`.
Systemic rationale:
- **S4 Defense** — protect append-only policy for governance anchors.
- **S6 Truth** — ensure receipts remain verifiable over time.
- **L4 Architecture / L5 Workflow** — surface clarity in CI + maintainer rhythms.
Sunset: remove if guard proves noisy or blocks legitimate reorders.
Fallback: manual review in doctor until receipts earned.
