# Proposal (draft)
# Task: Kelly ledger for autocollab
Goal: After each dry-run batch, append a CSV row summarizing items and readiness stats.
Systemic rationale:
- **S1 Unity** — shared ledger keeps batch outcomes discoverable.
- **S5 Intelligence** — supports recursive refinement via trend tracking.
- **S6 Truth** — ensures evidence remains queryable.
Sunset: Remove if we stop using autocollab; move to DB when needed.
Fallback: Manual note in STATUS.
Acceptance: `_report/ledger.csv` gains a new row with batch_ts,total_items,avg_score,total_score.
