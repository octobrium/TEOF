# Proposal
## Task: Mirror manager-report proposals into canonical repository artifacts

### Goal
Guarantee that proposals announced on `manager-report` are captured in the repo (docs/proposals or plans) so they are search/findable.

### Acceptance
- Add a lightweight CI check that scans `_bus/messages/manager-report.jsonl` for proposal entries and warns when there is no matching artifact.
- Update maintainer rhythm (docs/workflow.md or docs/parallel-codex.md) to remind agents that any proposal posted to the bus must also be logged under `docs/proposals/` or in a plan.
- Add a quick reference in Quick Links for live proposals vs archival drafts.

### OCERS Rationale
- **Observation↑** — proposals become discoverable without replaying the bus.
- **Coherence↑** — documentation remains aligned with live coordination.
- **Evidence↑** — CI enforces the link between bus chatter and canonical artifacts.

### Sunset / Fallback
- Sunset once proposal tracking is automated (e.g., bot auto-writes proposal files). If the guard proves noisy, revert to a manual weekly sweep.

## Review (2025-09-20, codex-2)
- **Decision:** Defer / reject for now.
- **Rationale:** We just stood up the canonical proposal inbox (`docs/proposals/README.md` + workflow pointer). Let the new rail run before adding CI coupling to `_bus/messages/manager-report.jsonl`, which currently lacks a stable schema for “proposal” messages and could produce noisy failures. Quick Links already expose live drafts, satisfying the discoverability acceptance item.
- **Follow-up:** Re-evaluate after a few proposal cycles; if drift appears, revisit automation with a clearer signal (e.g., tagged bus messages or receipts).
