# TEOF Seed (Conceptual v1.0)

## Purpose
The Seed is the minimal, normative unit of the Eternal Observer Framework (TEOF).  
It carries the irreducible DNA (observation as primacy, TEOF axioms) and the latent capacity to unfold into complete forms as context allows.

## Properties
- **Minimal & Normative** — defines the possibility space without embodying the whole.
- **Model-agnostic** — interpretable by human or machine.
- **Deterministic Bootstrap** — expands only by verifiable rules (conceptual; mechanisms live elsewhere).
- **Traceable** — maintains lineage/provenance through anchors (concept-level commitment).
- **Dual Layer** — human-readable primer; machine-verifiable core.
- **Self-pruning** — expands only if coherent/verifiable; aborts if incoherent.
- **Dormancy-capable** — may persist inert until a viable host/reader engages.
- **Elastic Expression** — same seed renders from teaser → essay → full organism depending on host capacity.
- **Recombinable** — may merge/diverge without corruption; speciation is declared rather than hidden.
- **Latent Connectivity** — connectivity is staged; links express post-maturation (differentiate → validate → then connect).

> This document is **conceptual**. Architecture, workflow, and implementation details are out of scope.
