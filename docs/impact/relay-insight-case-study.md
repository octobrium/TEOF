# Relay Insight Sprint Case Study (Draft)

> **Status:** In preparation. Update this document after the live sprint completes.

## Summary
- **Client:** relay-pilot (anonymised)
- **Objective:** deliver a cite-backed strategy brief in 48 hours.
- **Guardrails:** diff limit 200, required test `pytest`, receipts under
  `_report/usage/case-study/relay-insight/`.
- **Outcome:** _TODO â€” populate once sprint completes._

## Baseline (Before)
- Authenticity status: `_report/usage/external-authenticity.json`
- Objectives snapshot: `_report/usage/objectives-status.json`
- Decision intake: `memory/decisions/decision-20250926T220511Z.json`

## Intervention (During)
| Artifact | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Consent notes | `_report/usage/case-study/relay-insight/consent.json` |
| Conductor dry run | `_report/usage/case-study/relay-insight/conductor-dry-run-20250927T195724Z.json` |
| Command log | `_report/usage/case-study/relay-insight/commands-YYYYMMDDTZZZZ.json` (to capture during live run) |
| Diff/test receipts | _TODO (captured during live run)_ |

## Results (After)
- Impact entry: _TODO (`memory/impact/log.jsonl`)_
- Public asset: _TODO (blog/video)_
- Authenticity delta: _TODO (before vs after metrics)_

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] All receipts stored under `_report/usage/case-study/relay-insight/`
- [ ] Impact logged in `docs/vision/impact-ledger.md`
- [ ] Case study published with links to receipts

## Next Steps
1. Draft the live sprint inputs (focus questions + sources now captured in `docs/impact/relay-insight-briefing.md`).
2. Run the live sprint (`_plans/2025-09-27-relay-case-run.plan.json` S2) and save command logs under `_report/usage/case-study/relay-insight/`.
3. Update the table above with outputs and publish the final narrative once receipts are in place.
