## Summary
- **Client:** relay-pilot (anonymised)
- **Objective:** deliver a cite-backed strategy brief in 48 hours.
- **Guardrails:** diff limit 200, required test `pytest`, receipts under
  `_report/usage/case-study/relay-insight/`.
- **Outcome:** _TODO â€” populate once sprint completes._

## Baseline (Before)
- Authenticity status: `_report/usage/external-authenticity.json`
- Objectives snapshot: `_report/usage/objectives-status.json`
- Decision intake: `memory/decisions/decision-20250926T220511Z.json`
