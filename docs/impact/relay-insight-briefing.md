# Relay Insight Sprint Case Study Briefing

## Partner Profile
- **Type:** founder / operator seeking rapid market or diligence insight.
- **Engagement:** 48-hour Relay Insight Sprint (Tier B) to deliver a cite-backed
  strategy brief.

## Goals
- Demonstrate how TEOF’s guardrails (diff/test receipts, authenticity, objectives
  snapshot) de-risk unattended research loops.
- Produce a public case study showing faster decision turnaround with audited
  artifacts.

## Scope & Guardrails
- **Plan:** `2025-09-24-relay-offering` (S3) — run first client sprint.
- **Constraints:** diff budget 200 lines, required tests `pytest`, receipts under
  `_report/usage/case-study/relay-insight/`.
- **Consent:** partner approves publishing anonymised brief excerpt, command log,
  and guardrail receipts (signed consent stored under `_report/usage/case-study/relay-insight/consent.json`).

## Deliverables
1. Brief draft (Notion/PDF) referencing receipts.
2. Command log with `teof` prompts and conductor receipts.
3. Post-run reflection + impact log entry.
4. Public-facing case study (`docs/impact/relay-insight-case-study.md`).

## Timeline
- **Day 0:** Confirm consent, scope questions, gather inputs.
- **Day 1:** Run conductor w/ guardrails, collect artifacts.
- **Day 2:** Publish brief, log impact, draft case study.

## Success Metrics
- Pilot client feedback ≥4/5.
- Time to deliver brief ≤48h.
- Documented receipts: build + quickstart (already in place), conductor run,
  authenticity summary, impact log entry.

## Next Steps
1. Capture consent receipt (`tools.autonomy.decision_intake` if needed).
2. Schedule conductor run and assign bus claim for ND-014.
3. Prepare public case study template referencing the receipts above.
