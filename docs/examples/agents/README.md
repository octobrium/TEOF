# Agent manifest examples

Sample manifest files for local automation experiments now live here:

- `AGENT_MANIFEST.codex-2.json`
- `AGENT_MANIFEST.codex-3.json`
- `AGENT_MANIFEST.codex-4.json`
- `AGENT_MANIFEST.codex-manager.json`
- `AGENT_MANIFEST.example.json`

Copy one of these into the repository root as `AGENT_MANIFEST.json` (or symlink to it) before running agent tooling locally. Keeping the variants in `docs/examples/agents/` prevents duplicate manifests from cluttering the repo root while preserving canonical examples for testing and documentation.
