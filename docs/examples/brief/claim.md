# Claim: TEOF reduces unverifiable assumptions

Observation:
- Each assertion should be tied to observable data or a reproducible procedure.

Coherence:
- Steps must connect back to observation; unsupported claims are flagged.

Evidence:
- Example: OCERS validator checks markdown for unsupported statements.

Result:
- Pass/fail verdict with reasons and suggested fixes.

Scope:
- Applies to repo docs; external corpora need adapters.
