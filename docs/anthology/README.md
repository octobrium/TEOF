# TEOF Anthology

Purpose: capture non-normative reflections, metaphors, and long-horizon vision pieces that inform TEOF without acting as binding architecture. Entries here offer context and inspiration; operational rules still live under `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/workflow.md`, and governance DNA.

Guidelines:
- Mark each essay with status/intended audience.
- Link back to active ideas or plans when a concept graduates into execution.
- Keep canonical indexes (`docs/index.md`, governance mirrors) pointing to key entries.

Current entries:
- [Hyper-Organism (Conceptual)](./hyper-organism.md)
