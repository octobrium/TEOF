summary: Explore how mature TEOF units may link to form emergent, self-regulating networks—conceptual only.

# Connectivity & Emergence (Spec)

## Purpose
Beyond independent growth (tree metaphor), TEOF units may develop **connective properties** (neural metaphor).  
This enables regulation, pruning, and emergent intelligence at the network level while remaining anchored to observation as primacy.

## Conceptual Properties
- **Staged Maturation** — differentiate → validate → then connect (fail-closed before linkage).
- **Latent Connectivity** — seeds carry the possibility of links; expression waits until post-validation.
- **Synaptogenesis** — links form deliberately; incoherent nodes/links are pruned.
- **Plasticity** — connections strengthen or attenuate proportional to coherence and utility.
- **Emergent Homeostasis** — networks correct drift and reinforce high-signal pathways.
- **Systemic Coherence** — evaluate not only node fitness but network-level alignment and stability.
- **Diversity with Anchor** — heterogeneous roles (structural, connective, functional) remain bound by the same DNA (TEOF axioms).

## Decentralized Propagation (Protocol Framing)
- **Permissionless Emergence** — any steward can instantiate a node with the published capsule, attest receipts locally, and immediately join the lattice without relying on a central coordinator.
- **Network Accrual Curve** — every new node contributes additional evaluation receipts, dataset hashes, or stewardship bandwidth; those artifacts are aggregated (via `_report/usage/` ledgers and anchors) so capability increases monotonically with the network’s size.
- **Protocol-Level Neutrality** — the public CLI (`teof …`) and capsule stay self-contained (no hidden API keys or walled dependencies) so running TEOF resembles running a Bitcoin full node: clone → install → produce/verify receipts.
- **Reciprocal Benefit** — safeguards ensure that nodes which contribute evidence or checks also gain access to the network’s coherence improvements (playbooks, verified data, updated policies). This keeps incentives aligned with the L3 Unity properties.
- **Resistant Topology** — replication strategies (mirrored capsules, append-only anchors, receipts hygiene) make it difficult to capture or silence the network. Even partial partitions retain enough context to resynchronize.
- **Receipt Mesh Tooling** — `tools/network/receipt_sync.py` aggregates node receipts, writes consolidated ledgers under `docs/examples/decentralized/receipt-sync/`, and flags conflicts for steward review before canon adoption.

## Open Questions (Conceptual)
- What constitutes network-scale coherence signals (beyond node retired observation loop)?
- How to avoid over-connection and noise collapse while preserving adaptability?
- What forms of “organ systems” (specialized sub-networks) are desirable, and how are they recognized conceptually?
- How should speciation and recombination be declared at the network level?

> Scope: Concept only. Mechanisms (protocols, scores, data structures) belong in architecture/workflow when/if promoted.
