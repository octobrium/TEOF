# Agent Proposal Justification — 2025-09-18-codex4-consensus-draft

## Why this helps
The manager already seeded queue items 030–033 in `queue/` with minimal problem statements. To keep momentum, we should draft supporting plans/receipts for the first item (ledger CLI) so engineers have a concrete starting point. This addresses the open questions in the consensus context note and ensures the backlog refresh produces actionable work.

## Proposed change
Create a `2025-09-18-consensus-ledger-cli` plan detailing scope, receipts, and coordination steps for QUEUE-030. Include references to existing ledger tooling and metrics receipts so implementation is grounded.

## Receipts to collect
- `_plans/2025-09-18-consensus-ledger-cli.plan.json`
- `_plans/2025-09-18-consensus-ledger-cli.justification.md`

## Tests / verification
- None; planning artifact only.

## Ethics & safety notes
No executable changes.
