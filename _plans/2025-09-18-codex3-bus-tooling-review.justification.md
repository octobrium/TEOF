# Agent Proposal Justification â€” 2025-09-18-codex3-bus-tooling-review

## Why this helps
Recent bus tooling updates (claim guard, pruning cadence, window defaults) alter workflow expectations. Before a PR opens, we should validate the CLI suites and capture review notes so the manager has receipts and confidence in the changes.

## Proposed change
- Re-run the targeted pytest modules for `bus_message`, `task_assign`, and `bus_status`.
- Skim the associated docs so guidance matches behaviour (window defaults, guard usage).
- Publish a short review summary on QUEUE-011 citing receipts and any follow-ups.

## Receipts to collect
- `_report/agent/codex-3/bus-tooling-review/pytest.json`
- `_report/agent/codex-3/bus-tooling-review/notes.md`

## Tests / verification
- `pytest tests/test_agent_bus_message.py tests/test_agent_task_assign.py tests/test_agent_bus_status.py`

## Ethics & safety notes
Read-only verification and documentation receipts only; no governed artifacts altered.
