# Justification: 2025-10-03-backlog-advisory-report

- Newly synthesised advisory backlog (169 entries) lacks a summarized view, making prioritisation difficult.
- Operators need a quick report grouping advisories by plan/coordinate to choose the next fixes.
- Build automation to emit receipts summarising advisory clusters so ND-020 efforts stay focused.
