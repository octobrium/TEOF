# Justification: 2025-10-03-planner-metadata-backfill

- Fractal advisory report still flags 2025-09-17 planner + metrics plans for missing systemic metadata.
- These entries block ND-020 from shrinking because automation cannot infer coordinates from the plans.
- Backfilling retired observation loop, layer, and systemic scale unlocks advisory clearance for the planner tooling cluster.
