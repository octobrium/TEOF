# Plan Justification â€” 2025-09-18-l4-bindings

## Why now
The external audit flagged that L4 lacks explicit bindings between objectives/properties and the enforcement surface (CI jobs, scripts, receipts). Without this map, downstream automation can drift faster than the canon. Addressing the gap keeps propagation and defense layers grounded.

## Proposal
Author `governance/core/L4 - architecture/bindings.yml` that:
- Lists each active L2 objective and primary L3 property with a short tag.
- Maps every tag to the guard(s) or scripts that enforce it (e.g. `scripts/ci/check_plans.py`, `tests/test_agent_bus_status.py`).
- Includes receipt expectations so future changes know which artifacts to refresh.
Update `docs/architecture.md` (L4 section) to point at the bindings file and summarize the relationship between canon and automation.

## Receipts
- `_report/agent/codex-3/l4-bindings/notes.md`
- `_report/agent/codex-3/l4-bindings/diff-review.json`

## Tests / Verification
- `pytest tests/test_ci_check_plans.py` (spot-check existing binding coverage remains green).
- Documentation lint (implicit via CI) ensured by running `scripts/ci/check_docs.sh` if needed.

## Safety
Pure documentation + metadata addition within `governance/`; no functional code, only references. Changes are reversible and scoped to canon files.
