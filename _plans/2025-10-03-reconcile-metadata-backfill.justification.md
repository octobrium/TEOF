# Justification: 2025-10-03-reconcile-metadata-backfill

- Fractal advisory report still flags reconcile/bus automation plans from 2025-09-17/18 for missing OCERS metadata.
- These plans anchor ND-020 automation workflows; without layer/systemic data, backlog synthesis keeps re-adding advisories.
- Backfilling OCERS, layer, and systemic scale for the remaining cluster keeps the backlog trend downward and closes out the automation metadata debt.
