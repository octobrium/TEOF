# Agent Proposal Justification (Template)

## Why this helps
Explain the observed gap (failing test, stale doc, policy drift). Reference evidence: command output, queue ticket, or memory entry.

## Proposed change
Summarize the minimal diff (files, approximate LOC) and how it respects TEOF minimalism.

## Receipts to collect
List the receipts you will attach (`_report/...json`, command transcripts, hashes).

## Tests / verification
Enumerate the commands a human should run (pytest, scripts, linters). Mark any not run as TODO.

## Ethics & safety notes
Flag any data collection, credential use, or elevated risk. If none, state "None".
