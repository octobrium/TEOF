# Justification: 2025-10-03-autonomy-roadmap-metadata

- Remaining advisories point to autonomy conductor/roadmap, decision loop, and hygiene plans without systemic metadata.
- These are foundational for ND-020 automation; finishing the metadata pass keeps the backlog trending down.
- Backfilling metadata for this cluster prepares the backlog for the next milestone (doctor script + duplicate guard).
