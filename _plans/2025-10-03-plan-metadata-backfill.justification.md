# Justification: 2025-10-03-plan-metadata-backfill

- Fractal advisories flagged missing `systemic_targets`, `layer`, and `systemic_scale` metadata on early plan receipts.
- Without metadata, backlog synthesis cannot clear entries for foundational 2025-09-17 plans.
- Add the missing fields so automation can prioritise remaining plans accurately and ND-020 starts shrinking.
