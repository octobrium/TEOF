# Justification: 2025-10-03-authenticity-metadata-backfill

- Advisory backlog now highlights governance L1 hardening, autonomy status CLI, and authenticity automation plans lacking systemic metadata.
- These plans drive ND-020 automation and authenticity reporting; metadata gaps keep regenerating advisories.
- Backfilling retired observation loop, layer, and systemic scale ensures these policies are enforceable and ND-020 continues to shrink.
