# Justification: 2025-10-03-external-metadata-backfill

- Session/operator docs and external adoption plans still lack systemic metadata, so advisories persist.
- These plans guide onboarding and outreach; aligning them keeps ND-020 backlog shrinking.
- Backfilling metadata for this cluster maintains consistent enforcement across the canon.
