# Plan Justification â€” 2025-09-18-capsule-cadence

## Why this matters
After documenting capsule status (QUEUE-035), we still lack a concrete action plan for the next capsule release. Managers rely on scattered notes to know when to freeze, update anchors, and refresh docs.

## Proposal
Create `docs/maintenance/capsule-cadence.md` outlining:
- Target cadence (e.g., monthly or triggered by milestone).
- Required steps (freeze hashes, anchors update, STATUS file edits, release checklist).
- Responsible roles and receipts.

Also add a short summary reference in `docs/workflow.md` release block.

## Receipts
- `_report/agent/codex-3/capsule-cadence/notes.md`
- `_report/agent/codex-3/capsule-cadence/checklist.md`

## Safety
Docs-only change building on status markers.
