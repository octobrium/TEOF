# 2025-09-19-docs-quicklinks â€” Justification

## Objective
Make high-traffic guidance instantly accessible by introducing doc quick-links and a lightweight helper CLI, reducing time agents spend hunting for the canonical sections.

## Success Criteria
- Curated quick-link index covering architecture gate, receipts discipline, session loop, and coordination flows.
- Optional CLI (`tools/docs/quicklinks.py` or similar) that prints / opens those anchors deterministically.
- Onboarding and agents guide updated to reference the quick-link surface.
- Receipts stored under `_report/agent/codex-4/apoptosis-006/` with planner validation proof.
