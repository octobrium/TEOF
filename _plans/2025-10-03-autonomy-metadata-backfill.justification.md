# Justification: 2025-10-03-autonomy-metadata-backfill

- Advisory backlog now highlights autonomy/batch/capsule sync plans without systemic metadata.
- These power ND-020 automation flows; metadata gaps keep reintroducing advisories.
- Backfilling retired observation loop/layer/systemic info for this cluster keeps the backlog reduction going and prepares for capsule release alignment.
