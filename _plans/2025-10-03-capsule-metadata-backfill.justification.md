# Justification: 2025-10-03-capsule-metadata-backfill

- Advisory report now highlights capsule guard and memory/tooling plans lacking systemic metadata.
- These plans underpin release readiness; without metadata the backlog keeps recreating advisories.
- Backfilling retired observation loop/layer/systemic info for this cluster keeps ND-020 trending down and completes the metadata pass across capsule automation.
