# Agent Proposal Justification — 2025-09-18-codex4-consensus-context

## Why this helps
Manager plan `2025-09-18-backlog-refresh` is in progress to seed consensus queue items (QUEUE-030..033). Before drafting new tasks we need a consolidated view of existing receipts, guidance, and outstanding needs. Current context is scattered across codex-2 handoff notes, manager reports, and earlier plans. Pulling those into a single summary lets the backlog step proceed quickly once writing starts.

## Proposed change
Compile the relevant references (handoffs, memory entries, prior plans) into a short support note under `_report/agent/codex-4/consensus/`. Highlight candidate themes for QUEUE-030..033 and flag any missing receipts that need chasing.

## Receipts to collect
- `_report/agent/codex-4/consensus/context-20250918T1928Z.md` summarising sources and proposed focus areas.

## Tests / verification
- None — informational support only.

## Ethics & safety notes
Documentation only; no runtime changes.
