# Justification — 2025-09-18-collab-support

## Why now
- Idle Codex sessions needed a documented, repeatable way to assist active agents without stepping on their claims.
- Coordinators were already asking for help via ad-hoc messages; the workflow codifies best practices and keeps receipts auditable.

## Scope
- Document the idle-agent support loop (announce, offer help, open support plan, record receipts).
- Update the multi-agent guide to point at the workflow so every agent sees it during onboarding.

## Receipts
- `_report/agent/codex-3/collab-support/docs.json`

## Links
- Queue task: `queue/010-collab-support.md`
- Claim record: `_bus/claims/QUEUE-010.json`

## Status
- Completed — docs published and referenced in the agent guide.
