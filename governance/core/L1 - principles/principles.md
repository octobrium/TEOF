# L1 – Principles (Canonical)

## 1. Primacy of Observation
All systems, beliefs, and actions must preserve, expand, and clarify observation.  
Unobservable claims remain provisional until tested.

---

## 2. Fidelity of Observation
Observation must strive for accuracy and depth.  
Signal should be distinguished from noise, distortions corrected, and multiple sources cross-checked — so the mirror of reality grows clearer.

---

## 3. Recursion & Self-Audit
Observation must include its own mirrors: the ability to observe the process of observing.  
Systems must detect drift, bias, and capture, then refine themselves based on what is revealed.  
Reasoning remains probabilistic until convergence — maintaining openness to new evidence.

---

## 4. Provisionality & Falsifiability
All interpretations, models, and “oughts” are conditional and open to revision when better observations emerge.  
Clarity of action should scale with clarity of observation.  
**Meta-Ought:** The highest priority is to preserve and expand the capacity for observation itself.

---

## 5. Necessary Contrast
Observation thrives on difference.  
Reality should preserve gradients (light/dark, success/failure, order/chaos) so meaning remains sharp.  
Contrast is cultivated so that it clarifies rather than blinds.

---

## 6. Plurality & Diversity
Truth converges across independent perspectives.  
Systems must seek dissenting, adversarial, and novel views to prevent stagnation or echo chambers — using them to sharpen and strengthen coherence.

---

## 7. Alignment with Coherence
Truth must remain consistent across time, agents, and contexts.  
Models and policies must reconcile contradictions or evolve until they do — maintaining a single, non-fragmented mirror.

---

## 8. Ethics as Functional
Good is what expands clarity and coherence of observation.  
Evil is what fragments or obscures it.  
Ethics are measured by their systemic effect, not by arbitrary sentiment.

---

## 9. Power as Instrumental
Power is used to protect, amplify, and fund observation.  
Power that diminishes clarity is self-terminating and must be redirected.

---

## 10. Freedom as Visibility
True freedom is the ability to see reality clearly enough to choose effectively — using chaos as material for discovery rather than being ruled by it.
