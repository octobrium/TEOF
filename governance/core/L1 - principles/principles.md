# L1 – Principles (as Observations)

Status: Summary (Advisory)  
Canonical source: `governance/core/L1 - principles/canonical-teof.md`

> These are **observations about reality** — patterns found to persist across nature, history, and systems.  
> They are not rules but lenses: if true, they imply certain objectives for any system that wants to survive and stay coherent.

### 1. Unity (Foundation of Being)
- **Observation is Primordial:** Wherever awareness arises, observation is already present. To deny observation is to observe the denial.  
- **Patterns That Persist Indicate Fitness:** Over time, reality selects for what survives. Structures that recur across domains signal systemic advantage.  
- **Coherence Sustains Existence:** Systems that stay internally consistent while remaining minimal endure longer and spread further. Complexity tends to grow when it increases systemic fitness.  
- **Complexity Emerges in Order:** Systems tend to organize from simple, unified states into progressively more complex layers — first establishing cohesion, then sustaining energy flow, then propagating, defending, and integrating information. Attempts to invert this order often destabilize or collapse.  
- **Adaptive Balance of Cohesion & Distribution:** Enduring systems tune centralizing and decentralizing forces over time to maintain coherence without stagnation or fragmentation.

### 2. Energy (Fidelity & Flow)
- **Clarity Conserves Energy:** Distinguishing signal from noise reduces wasted effort and preserves usable energy.  
- **Channels That Sustain Life Are Preserved:** Systems that maintain their sources of energy, attention, and observation persist; those that deplete them tend to collapse.  
- **Energy Access Expands Capacity:** Systems with greater energy and compute sustain more complex observation and coordination — until resource strain destabilizes them.

---

### 3. Propagation (Growth & Legibility)
- **Variation Drives Adaptation:** When variation is present, systems explore more of the solution space and become more resilient — until variation exceeds coherence, at which point fragmentation occurs.  
- **Contrast Sharpens Meaning:** Differentiation between states (success/failure, light/dark) gives observation salience and drives evolution.  
- **Legibility Predicts Transmission:** Systems that are interpretable and reproducible are more likely to propagate across time and context.  
- **Portability Increases Survival:** Systems that can be instantiated in multiple substrates or contexts are more likely to endure across time and change.

---

### 4. Defense (Integrity & Drift Control)
- **Self-Observation Enables Correction:** Systems capable of monitoring their own processes reduce drift and resist capture.  
- **Truth Remains Conditional:** Claims that remain open to falsification converge more closely with reality over time.  
- **Resilience Through Challenge:** Systems that survive stress integrate the lessons of survival and become stronger, more coherent, and harder to disrupt.

---

### 5. Intelligence & Truth
- **Consistency Correlates with Strength:** Systems that reconcile contradictions create a single, durable mirror of reality.

---

### 6–10. Power, Ethics, Freedom, Meaning
- **Clarity Correlates with Survival:** Systems that increase clarity coordinate more effectively and persist longer; systems that obscure collapse more quickly.  
- **Power Follows Effective Observation:** Influence concentrates where observation is effective and actionable.  
- **Alignment Rewards Survival:** When feedback loops reward behaviors that improve observation, systems remain coherent; when they reward distortion, systems destabilize and collapse.  
- **Freedom Emerges with Visibility:** Choice becomes more effective when relevant parts of reality are perceived.  
- **Meaning Emerges from Alignment:** When unity, energy, propagation, defense, and truth cohere, the result is experienced as significant.
