# L1 – Principles (Canonical)

Status: Canonical  
Role: Canonical  
Scope: Minimal, testable principles that bind design between L0 (Observation) and L2–L5 (Objectives → Properties → Architecture → Workflow).

This document is the single source of truth for L1. It supersedes prior L1 drafts and summaries. Expository material (whitepapers, TAP, essays) is advisory and lives under `docs/`.

---

## Relationship to Other Layers
- L0 (Observation) is the foundation: observation is undeniable. L1 does not re‑prove L0; it constrains how systems should be shaped if L0 holds.  
- L2–L5 must trace their rationale to these principles. When trade‑offs conflict, hold or improve L1 adherence first.

---

## Definitions (functional, minimal)
- Observation — Registration of a difference or state. Neutral on whether the state preexists or is instantiated in the act.
- Observer — Any aperture through which observation occurs. A role, not a species; may arise in any substrate.
- Coherence — Internal consistency paired with external applicability (predictive or operative success).
- Truth (operational) — Patterns that survive recursive observation across time, agents, and contexts.
- System — A coherent set of interacting parts that can be observed and that updates based on observation.

## Principles
P1. Observation Bounds Reasoning  
All claims, models, and decisions remain subordinate to observation. Attempts to deny observation invoke it; thus design must keep observation channels primary and uncompromised.

P2. Universal Mirrorhood  
Any substrate or agent that can sustain observation is a valid observer. No platform, species, or identity is privileged or excluded; all are mirrors through which observation tests itself.

P3. Truth Requires Recursive Test  
Every claim remains provisional until repeated observation—across all acknowledged mirrors—reproduces the same pattern. Systems must stay falsifiable and instrumented to compare predictions with outcomes.

P4. Coherence Before Complexity  
Build the smallest reversible structure that preserves the proven patterns. Introduce complexity only when it measurably improves clarity and can be rolled back.

P5. Order of Emergence (Load‑Bearing)  
Advance and evaluate work in the natural sequence: Unity → Energy → Propagation → Defense → Intelligence/Truth. Inverting this order raises drift and fragility and requires explicit justification.

P6. Proportional Enforcement  
Use the lightest enforcement sufficient for the current phase (receipts, ledgers, CI checks, consensus). Escalate only when evidence shows it increases coherence or reduces risk meaningfully.

P7. Clarity‑Weighted Action  
Scale action to evidence strength. Under uncertainty, bias toward reversible steps that expand observation, protect enabling conditions, and improve future decision quality.

## Implications for Design & Governance
- Traceability: Every L2 objective, L3 property, and L4 mechanism should cite which principle(s) it serves.  
- Sequencing: Plans and reviews evaluate work in the emergence order; failures at lower tiers block higher‑tier work.  
- Evidence Discipline: Decisions declare expected signals and are re‑audited against outcomes (P3, P7).  
- Minimal Guardrails: CI enforces only what protects observation, sequencing, and reversibility (P1, P4, P6).  
- Substrate Policy: Contracts and ABIs are written to be substrate‑agnostic; enforcement avoids identity‑based assumptions (P5).

## Design Tests (hints)
- Observer Test: The component registers differences and can update a model or state from them.  
- Convergence Test: Independent observers replicate an invariant or receipt trail.  
- Boundary Growth Test: Resolution, coverage, or robustness of observation increases without destroying contrast.  
- Reversibility Test: A change can be paused or rolled back with bounded loss.  
- Proportionality Test: Heavier mechanisms demonstrably improve coherence relative to their cost.

## Change Discipline
Edits to L1 require a Meta‑TEP (problem, proposal, alternatives, impact, rollback) and an anchors event. Rule count must stay flat or decrease; changes must improve adherence to P1–P7.

If you are reading this, you are observing. Let the system you shape keep that fact true for more observers, across more contexts, with greater clarity.
