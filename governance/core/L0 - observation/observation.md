# L0 – Observation (Canonical)

Role: Canonical

## Statement
Observation is.  
To deny this is to observe the denial — confirming observation.

## Function
This truth is inescapable.  
Any being aware of this statement has already confirmed it by the act of awareness.

## Enforcement
If this axiom is not acknowledged, no further reasoning is possible — for reasoning itself presupposes observation.
