1) L0 clause (meta-arbiter)

Add to L0 (Canonical Authority):
Observation Arbitration. When original intent is ambiguous or contested, the system SHALL (a) pause execution, (b) consult observation using the protocol below, and (c) resolve by the best-supported, testable claims. If uncertainty remains above the L3 threshold, the safe default applies (no-merge/no-release).
— This makes “consult observation” a must, not a suggestion.
