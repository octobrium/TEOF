# Core Governance Index

Status map for canonical documents within `governance/core/`.

- L3 — Properties: Canonical  
  Path: `governance/core/L3 - properties/properties.md`

  Enforcement map (authoritative): `governance/core/L4 - architecture/bindings.yml`

- L5 — Workflow: Canonical  
  Path: `governance/core/L5 - workflow/workflow.md`

- L6 — Unassigned (this phase)
