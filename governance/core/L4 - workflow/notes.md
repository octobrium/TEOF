All systems must maintain homeostasis over time, against entropy

Workflow directly serves and operates to maintain / expand architecture

Components of workflow:

Maintain / audit existing good workflow
 - Record keeping: hash generation, checking etc
Run compatibility checks on growth pushes / expansion in scope
Simplify redundant components / keep clean / organize repo / consolidate / improve efficiency / apoptosis

Biological analogues:

DNA polymerase, i.e check to ensure core documents are pristine
- record-keeping
- proofreading
- repair
- consolidation / simplification / organization
- coordination
- detection / flagging
- apoptosis
- automation

As always, most critical components / functionalities are checked / prioritized first


Ideally, a check should exist for every desired architectural property i.e architecture aims to minimize attack surface, and achieve maximal desired function with least steps = workflow should exist to try to detect and guard against overcomplication. 

- ensures core files stay pristine over time, with any updates immutably hashed / recorded
- ensure all files exist where they should exist, and flags any changes
- preflight, smoke tests, doctor, etc etc 
- make as simple as possible, making changes and pushing updates to repo: automation, consolidation of steps.

Make development future proof and not get more annoying as complexity evolves

- all workflow should trend, within reason, towards automation
- minimize manual checking
- recursive analysis and suggestion of improvement / optimization
