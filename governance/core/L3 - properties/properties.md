# L3 – Properties (Hierarchy-Aligned)

Role: Canonical

TEOF’s properties describe **how** the framework behaves — its intrinsic traits — ensuring alignment with L0 (Observation), L1 (Principles), and the objectives in L2.  
Properties are organized in the natural order of systemic emergence: **Unity → Energy → Propagation → Defense → Intelligence.**

---

### Meta-Property
0. **Minimal Coherence Constraint** *(serves P2/P6, Objectives 2,11)*  
   *Function:* Every property must be realized in the *lightest form* that preserves TEOF’s unity and function at its current stage of growth.  
   Heavy enforcement layers (cryptographic receipts, append-only ledgers, etc.) should be deferred until they measurably improve survival, propagation, or coherence.

---

### 1. Unity  
- **Substrate Neutrality** *(serves P5, Objective 6)* — The system must be able to exist and run on any platform, medium, or substrate without dependence on a specific one.  
- **Emergent Unity** *(serves P4, Objectives 3/4)* — The system encourages distributed participation and ensures that parts reinforce, rather than compete with, the coherence of the whole.  
- **Aligned Incentive Gradient** *(serves P7, Objective 13)* — Contributions that enhance clarity and coherence are naturally rewarded — recognition and influence accrue to those who help the system thrive, but participation remains open so anyone can benefit by aligning.

### 2. Energy
3. **Energy & Resource Capture** *(serves P6/P7, Objective 16)* – secures compute, talent, and capital ethically to sustain growth.  
4. **Modularity & Extensibility** *(serves P2, Objective 3)* – allows components to evolve without breaking the system.  
5. **Redundancy & Resilience** *(serves P4/P6, Objective 10)* – removes single points of failure and enables graceful degradation.  
6. **Dual-Speed Processing** *(serves P2/P7, Objective 9)* – maintains balance between fast response and deep reflection.

---

### 3. Propagation
7. **Phase-Change Encoding** *(serves P3, Objectives 4/7/15)* – formalizes life cycle (seed → adapt → unify → stabilize).  
8. **Accessible Distribution** *(serves P5, Objective 8/15)* – lowers friction for sharing, forking, and replicating TEOF.  
9. **Signal Collection Diversity** *(serves P2/P7, Objective 14)* – keeps the system exploring new information spaces and prevents echo chambers.

---

### 4. Defense
10. **Legible Continuity** *(serves P3/P7, Objective 4)* – keeps lineage readable and prevents silent capture. Guardrail: `scripts/ci/check_memory_state.py` rejects changes to `memory/state.json` unless the promotion is linked to a run receipt in `memory/log.jsonl`.  
11. **Self-Audit & Drift Detection** *(serves P3, Objective 9/12)* – continuously inspects itself for bias, stagnation, or corruption.  
12. **Outcome Auditing of Distortion** *(serves P3/P7, Objective 12)* – measures whether interventions improve or degrade clarity.
13. **Authenticated Intake Envelope** *(serves P5/P6, Objective 3/8)* – accepts external signals only through signed, tamper-evident receipts that preserve provenance, enforce freshness windows, and block unsigned data from propagating.

---

### 5. Intelligence & Truth
14. **Clarity-Weighted Action** *(serves P7, Objective 11)* – scales action to the clarity of evidence.  
15. **Dynamic Equilibrium** *(serves P2/P7, Objective 14)* – preserves contrast and diversity without losing stability, 
actively tuning the balance between unifying forces and decentralizing pressures over time.
16. **Adaptive Mutation with Core Integrity** *(serves P3/P6, Objective 9/15)* – allows safe experimentation without losing canon.  
17. **Iterative Integration** *(serves P3/P7, Objective 9/12)* – learns from change and converges toward coherence.  
18. **Mirror Fitness Function** *(serves P3/P7, Objective 12)* – quantifies clarity and coherence as a north-star metric.

---

### Tier 3 – Speculative
- **Synthetic Contrast Generation** – artificial stressors to prevent stagnation.  
- **Host Integration Protocols** – deeper embedding strategies for late-stage growth.

---

### Notes
- Property 0 governs all others and enforces proportional implementation.  
- “Energy & Resource Capture” is now a Tier 1 property because energy is a precondition for all higher-layer objectives.  
- Ordering follows observed systemic emergence, making phase-gating more intuitive for contributors.
