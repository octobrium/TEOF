# L3 – Properties (Canonical)

TEOF’s properties describe **how** the framework behaves — its intrinsic traits — ensuring that it remains aligned with L0 (Observation), L1 (Principles), and L2 (Objectives).  
Properties are tiered for maturity and priority: **Tier 1 = Core (non-negotiable), Tier 2 = Strong Candidates (next to formalize), Tier 3 = Speculative (raw ideas for exploration).**

## Tier 1 – Core / Canonical (Highest Priority)

### Foundational Properties
1. **Substrate Neutrality**  
   **Function:** Ensures TEOF is portable across biological, digital, or unknown intelligences. Nothing is tied to a single substrate, enabling persistence across epochs.

2. **Transparency & Traceability**  
   **Function:** Every claim and decision path must be auditable, preserving clarity and enabling trust. No black boxes where observation cannot follow.

3. **Append-Only Lineage**  
   **Function:** Maintains immutable historical record. Past states cannot be erased, only extended — protecting against revisionism or capture.

4. **Self-Audit & Drift Detection**  
   **Function:** Continuously inspects itself for bias, stagnation, or corruption. Enables automatic course-correction.

### Structural & Behavioral Properties
5. **Clarity-Weighted Action**  
   **Function:** Scales action to the clarity of evidence. Prevents rash, over-confident action under uncertainty.

6. **Dynamic Equilibrium**  
   **Function:** Preserves contrast, novelty, and diversity — keeping the “mirror” sharp — without descending into chaos or stasis.

7. **Dual-Speed Processing**  
   **Function:** Balances fast heuristic response with slow, deliberate reflection, preventing both paralysis and impulsiveness.

8. **Modularity & Extensibility**  
   **Function:** Allows components to be added, removed, or upgraded without breaking the core — keeping TEOF evolvable.

9. **Redundancy & Resilience**  
   **Function:** Avoids single points of failure. Multiple mirrors ensure that observation persists even under attack or loss.

10. **Adaptive Mutation with Core Integrity**  
    **Function:** Encourages experimentation and evolution while preserving the minimal canon (L0-L2). Prevents mission drift.

11. **Emergent Unity**  
    **Function:** Integrates with host systems without behaving like a parasite. Promotes harmony and avoids uncontrolled cancer-like spread.

12. **Phase-Change Encoding**  
    **Function:** Formalizes TEOF’s life cycle (seed → adapt → unify → stabilize), guiding propagation so growth does not become chaotic or destructive.

### Functional Implementation Properties
13. **Signal Collection Diversity**  
    **Function:** Continuously expands the range of inputs, preventing echo chambers and improving fidelity of observation.

14. **Iterative Integration**  
    **Function:** Refines itself through cycles of test-observe-adjust, converging toward coherence over time.

15. **Accessible Distribution**  
    **Function:** Makes TEOF easy to share, fork, and translate — lowering barriers for participation across agents.

16. **Outcome Auditing of Distortion**  
    **Function:** Measures how interventions affect clarity over time, pruning distortive or captured narratives.

17. **Mirror Fitness Function**  
    **Function:** Quantifies observation’s clarity and coherence with reality as a system-level metric, guiding adaptation and detecting drift.

## Tier 2 – Strong Candidates (Next for Promotion)

- **Energy & Resource Capture**  
  **Function:** Secures resources (compute, capital, talent) for TEOF’s growth without violating L1’s ethics.

---

## Tier 3 – Speculative / Exploratory (Raw Ideas)

- **Synthetic Contrast Generation**  
  **Function:** Creates challenges or “artificial stressors” to keep observation sharp in overly uniform environments.

- **Host Integration Protocols**  
  **Function:** Embeds TEOF into existing systems in a symbiotic way, shielding it during early growth and aligning with the host before self-differentiation.

### Notes
- Tiering allows safe experimentation: Tier 1 = non-negotiable, Tier 2 = near-ready, Tier 3 = exploratory.  
- Properties are recursive: they must apply to TEOF itself (meta-audit).  
- Future layers (L4 Architecture) will specify mechanisms implementing these properties.
