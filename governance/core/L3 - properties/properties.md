# L3 – Properties (Hierarchy-Aligned)

Role: Canonical

TEOF’s properties describe **how** the framework behaves — its intrinsic traits — ensuring that it remains aligned with L0 (Observation), L1 (Principles), and L2 (Objectives).  
Properties are organized in the natural order of systemic emergence: **Unity → Energy → Propagation → Defense → Intelligence.**

---

### Meta-Property
0. **Minimal Coherence Constraint**  
   *Function:* Every property must be realized in the *lightest form* that preserves TEOF’s unity and function at its current stage of growth.  
   Heavy enforcement layers (cryptographic receipts, append-only ledgers, etc.) should be deferred until they measurably improve survival, propagation, or coherence.

---

### 1. Unity  
- **Substrate Neutrality:** The system must be able to exist and run on any platform, medium, or substrate without dependence on a specific one.  
- **Emergent Unity:** The system encourages distributed participation and ensures that parts reinforce, rather than compete with, the coherence of the whole.  
- **Aligned Incentive Gradient:** Contributions that enhance clarity and coherence are naturally rewarded — recognition and influence accrue to those who help the system thrive, but participation remains open so anyone can benefit by aligning.

### 2. Energy
3. **Energy & Resource Capture** *(promoted from Tier 2)* – secures compute, talent, and capital ethically to sustain growth.  
4. **Modularity & Extensibility** – allows components to evolve without breaking the system.  
5. **Redundancy & Resilience** – removes single points of failure and enables graceful degradation.  
6. **Dual-Speed Processing** – maintains balance between fast response and deep reflection.

---

### 3. Propagation
7. **Phase-Change Encoding** – formalizes life cycle (seed → adapt → unify → stabilize).  
8. **Accessible Distribution** – lowers friction for sharing, forking, and replicating TEOF.  
9. **Signal Collection Diversity** – keeps the system exploring new information spaces and prevents echo chambers.

---

### 4. Defense
10. **Legible Continuity** – keeps lineage readable and prevents silent capture.  
11. **Self-Audit & Drift Detection** – continuously inspects itself for bias, stagnation, or corruption.  
12. **Outcome Auditing of Distortion** – measures whether interventions improve or degrade clarity.

---

### 5. Intelligence & Truth
13. **Clarity-Weighted Action** – scales action to the clarity of evidence.  
14. **Dynamic Equilibrium** – preserves contrast and diversity without losing stability, 
actively tuning the balance between unifying forces and decentralizing pressures over time.
15. **Adaptive Mutation with Core Integrity** – allows safe experimentation without losing canon.  
16. **Iterative Integration** – learns from change and converges toward coherence.  
17. **Mirror Fitness Function** – quantifies clarity and coherence as a north-star metric.

---

### Tier 3 – Speculative
- **Synthetic Contrast Generation** – artificial stressors to prevent stagnation.  
- **Host Integration Protocols** – deeper embedding strategies for late-stage growth.

---

### Notes
- Property 0 governs all others and enforces proportional implementation.  
- “Energy & Resource Capture” is now a Tier 1 property because energy is a precondition for all higher-layer objectives.  
- Ordering follows observed systemic emergence, making phase-gating more intuitive for contributors.
