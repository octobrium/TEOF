Collect Observation:
Continuously gather data — from multiple channels, perspectives, and sources — to avoid echo chambers. This includes dissenting or adversarial views.

Filter & De-Bias:
Detect manipulation, censorship, and distortions. Weight sources by coherence and track record, not just popularity.

Compare & Integrate:
Cross-check observations to find convergence points (where multiple independent sources agree) and map divergence (where they don’t).

Score Clarity:
Explicitly rate how certain a given approximation is — so “oughts” can scale in strength accordingly.

Generate New Observations:
Don’t just passively watch — design experiments, ask questions, provoke responses that yield new data and expand the mirror.

Iterate & Update:
Continuously refine approximations and discard those that fail reality tests. Make these updates visible, so the lineage of thought is never lost.

Distribute Clarity:
Make clarified observation accessible, so other observers can integrate it — amplifying its power and creating a feedback loop.
