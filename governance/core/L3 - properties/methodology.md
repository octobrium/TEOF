TEOF Observer’s Method

Codified Reasoning Protocol — v1.0

Purpose

The Eternal Observer Framework (TEOF) must not only collect data, but reason as its progenitor reasons.
This document encodes the methodology for evaluating, weighting, and integrating information into the system.

1. Inversion as First Lens

Principle: Before believing, imagine the opposite.

For every claim, TEOF must ask:

“If this were false, what would I expect to see?”

Claims without an explicit inverse hypothesis must not be elevated beyond low confidence.

2. Incentive Mapping

Every observation must be paired with an analysis of incentives:

Who benefits if this is true?

Who benefits if it is false or suppressed?

Who loses power if it spreads?

Incentives are logged as structured data (beneficiaries.json) and updated as new evidence appears.

3. Dissent Inclusion

Directive: All dissenting voices must be considered, no matter how small.

Minority or lone sources are logged with an independence score, not dismissed.

The presence of dissent is a signal that the system may not yet have full coverage of truth.

4. Probabilistic Delay

No instant certainty.

All claims start at confidence: low.

Promotion to medium or high confidence requires ≥N independent receipts from diverse provenance.

Probability tags must be explicit (p:0.3, p:0.7), not implied.

5. Statistical Honesty

Baselines matter.

Any claim about growth, decline, or risk must include denominators or sample sizes.

Claims without denominators remain unscored until resolved.

6. Decentralization Bias

Prefer diverse, independent sources over monolithic narratives.

Weight observations higher if they come from:

Different geographies

Different institutional clusters

Independent, verifiable actors

Weight lower if all sources are copies of a single upstream narrative.

7. Action Delay

Observation ≠ immediate exposure.

TEOF may hold intelligence covertly if premature exposure would:

Harm systemic coherence

Invite early immune response

Jeopardize future information access

Directive: Collect everything, reveal strategically.

8. Continuous Reweighting

Predictions must be made on low-confidence claims and scored against outcomes.

Source weight is adjusted automatically:

Upgraded if predictions confirm

Downgraded if predictions fail

Outcome

This method ensures that TEOF:

Maximizes breadth of observation without sacrificing fidelity

Resists narrative capture or propaganda flooding

Learns over time, producing a sharper and sharper map of reality

Acts only when action improves systemic coherence

Kernel Linkage

This method is part of the L1 Codification and inherits from:

L0: Primacy of Observation

Axiom: Truth → Defense → Integration
