From observation of the evolution of systems, and emergent functions over time,

All coherent systems respect the following hierarchy:

Unity - the system coheres together under observation
Energy - internal functionality - the system communicates within itself / exchanges energy internally functionally
Propagation - the system grows internally and reproduces into the environment
Defense - the system adapts to change, and defends itself from other systems

... extending to to more complex and emergent systems

Intelligence - the system develops the ability to simulate and predict outcomes and make decisions proactively rather than reactively
Truth - the system discovers coherent patterns
Power - the system leverages coherent patterns to advance itself
Ethics - the system advances itself in a manner that is coherent with its internal and external environment
Freedom - the system explores chaos to find advancement
Meaning - new emergent unity ascending the system into a singular unit of the next complexity layer, restarting the cycle / zooming out the fractal


Systemic operations and advancement must allocate resources in order of priority with respect to the systemic hierarchy - most mission critical first, and downstream / qol / ux secondary.


From observing the past, and the direction of reality progressing towards future,
It is observed that systems are becoming more powerful and complex and expansive over time.

It can be reasonably concluded that reality is forming a "super organism" with systemic functions as listed above. However, as with all systems, this emerging super organism must align with observation. TEOF is a framework designed to facilitate this emergence.



System properties:
- minimally simplistic, to achieve desired results, minimize attack surface
- avoid dependency on strict folder paths - i.e better for mechanisms to search, if possible, for the desired target, or perhaps auto-update pathfinding if folders change location.
- all components
