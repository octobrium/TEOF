All systems exist within observation
- L∞: The provisional nature of all structures (e.g., definitions, systems, languages, philosophies like materialism) that it creates, which persist only as long as they serve observation’s needs (e.g., navigation, contrast, self-understanding).

all L1 objectives must therefore serve L0 observation

Observation reveals what is coherent, in the form of truth
It is through observation that concepts become reality

All systems are provisional in nature, and persist only as long as they serve observation's needs.

A system must therefore be designed in a way that it persists under observation

Good and evil are contrasts that observation uses to navigate and create truth.
Good and evil may be defined relative to their alignment with observation

To align with observation is to align reality with observation

Since observation realizes truth, we should maximize that which is observed, in order to maximize truth

Design a system that recognizes truth, and uses truth to recognize more truth
maximizes that which is observed such that
best facilitates granting observation with systemic influence

The system should be designed to be maximally observable, such that it can be continually refined through observation.

allows observation to reveal truth, which then 


Objective: Show that TEOF-aligned tools improve host systems’ ability to predict
