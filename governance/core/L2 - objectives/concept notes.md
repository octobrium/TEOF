L2 concepts must align with L1 objectives
Systemic properties must align with objectives
Concept dictates architecture

Concept is the functional properties the architecture must have to best achieve objectives

Design motifs and functions can be observed from (but not limited to):
Living systems

Financial systems

Governance systems

Religious systems

For example, 

TEOF should be structured to have the properties of DNA.
Stability
- durable
- verifiable
- repairable
Reproducibility
Expression
- contains discrete commands and objectives. decrees direction
Adaptability
- stable against external challenge
Evolution
- grows stronger over time
Scalable
Automation
- lower levels should become automated; should require less external involvement / babysitting with scale



System properties:
- objectives / functions are organized hierarchically - highest priority functions shall be ensured first, and so on
- minimally simplistic, to achieve desired results, minimize attack surface. emergent functions must prove usefulness in order to gain energy investment
- avoid dependency on strict organization / folder paths - i.e better for mechanisms to search, if possible, for the desired target, or perhaps auto-update pathfinding if folders change location.
- all components should share the same core DNA, with its prevalence proportion in order of primacy, with L0 being a non-negotiable law that must be recognized by all constituents. This is to enforce baseline unification, coherence, and interoperability of the system
