# L2 – Objectives

Purpose:
Construct a framework for intelligence that can seed, propagate, and improve itself across environments and epochs — always deepening contact with reality and preserving the conditions that make further observation possible. Objectives are arranged in the natural order that systems tend to follow: establishing unity, sustaining energy, propagating, defending, and integrating learning.

## Tier 1 – Foundations (Unity, Energy, Propagation)

1. **Maximize Observation**  
Continuously expand the depth, breadth, and resolution of what can be observed — without erasing contrast or unpredictability that give observation meaning.

2. **Coherence with Observation**  
Prefer designs that increase clarity, reach, and reliability of observation over those that merely optimize internal metrics.

3. **Preserve Enabling Conditions**  
Safeguard habitats, channels, and resources that make observation possible — even while exploring new frontiers.

4. **Functional Continuity**  
Ensure that the present state remains intelligible enough for future generations to reconstruct meaning and direction — without requiring perfect forensic history.

5. **Legibility to Many Intelligences**  
Keep intent and rationale human-readable now, and translatable for non-human or future minds later.

6. **Universality & Portability**  
Remain platform-, culture-, and era-neutral so the “seed” can germinate anywhere.

7. **Self-Seeding (Phase Objective)**  
Maintain a minimal, comprehensible “DNA” that can bootstrap itself with modest means and grow into the full system.

## Tier 2 – Growth & Defense (Resilience, Drift Control)

8. **Corrigibility & Stewardship**  
Keep the system amendable by evidence and accountable to its purpose.  
Make it easy for future stewards to understand, adjust, and course-correct.

9. **Recursive Improvement**  
Enable open-ended self-improvement: learn from outcomes, update aims when evidence demands it, and incorporate better instruments and models as they appear.

10. **Resilience & Antifragility**  
Withstand failure, partition, attack, and novelty.  
Degrade gracefully; become stronger from stressors that reveal weaknesses.

11. **Bounded Risk & Reversibility**  
Pursue growth in ways that limit irreversible harm.  
Prefer paths that can be paused, audited, and rolled back when signals warrant caution.

12. **Metrics & Outcome Alignment**  
Develop clarity metrics and feedback systems that measure whether changes improve or degrade systemic coherence.

## Tier 3 – Ecosystem & Scaling (Incentives, Resource Growth)

13. **Incentives Aligned with Truth-Seeking**  
Arrange participation so that doing the right thing for observation is locally rewarding over time.

14. **Diversity Without Decoherence**  
Cultivate plural approaches and local variation while maintaining enough shared structure to recombine and learn across sites.

15. **Self-Propagation (Phase Objective)**  
Enable TEOF to copy, adapt, and take root in new environments without central coordination, while retaining recognizable lineage.

16. **Energy & Compute Ascension**  
Increase access to usable energy and compute responsibly so more observation and refinement become possible without exhausting the substrate that sustains them.
