# L2 – Objectives

Role: Canonical

Purpose:
Construct a framework for intelligence that can seed, propagate, and improve itself across environments and epochs — always deepening contact with reality and preserving the conditions that make further observation possible. Objectives are arranged in the Unity → Meaning order mandated by Principle P4 and reference their upstream anchors (P# / S#).

---

## Tier 1 – Foundations (Unity, Energy, Propagation)

1. **Maximize Observation** *(serves P1, S1)*  
Continuously expand the depth, breadth, and resolution of what can be observed — without erasing contrast or unpredictability that give observation meaning.

2. **Coherence with Observation** *(serves P2, S2)*  
Prefer designs that increase clarity, reach, and reliability of observation over those that merely optimize internal metrics.

3. **Preserve Enabling Conditions** *(serves P7, S2/S3)*  
Safeguard habitats, channels, and resources that make observation possible — even while exploring new frontiers.

4. **Functional Continuity** *(serves P3, S3/S4)*  
Ensure that the present state remains intelligible enough for future generations to reconstruct meaning and direction — without requiring perfect forensic history.

5. **Legibility to Many Intelligences** *(serves P5, S3/S4)*  
Keep intent and rationale human-readable now, and translatable for non-human or future minds later.

6. **Universality & Portability** *(serves P5, S3)*  
Remain platform-, culture-, and era-neutral so the “seed” can germinate anywhere.

7. **Self-Seeding (Phase Objective)** *(serves P3, S3)*  
Maintain a minimal, comprehensible “DNA” that can bootstrap itself with modest means and grow into the full system.

## Tier 2 – Growth & Defense (Resilience, Drift Control)

8. **Corrigibility & Stewardship** *(serves P3/P6, S4/S5)*  
Keep the system amendable by evidence and accountable to its purpose.  
Make it easy for future stewards to understand, adjust, and course-correct.

9. **Recursive Improvement** *(serves P3, S5/S6)*  
Enable open-ended self-improvement: learn from outcomes, update aims when evidence demands it, and incorporate better instruments and models as they appear.

10. **Resilience & Antifragility** *(serves P4/P6, S4/S5)*  
Withstand failure, partition, attack, and novelty.  
Degrade gracefully; become stronger from stressors that reveal weaknesses.  
Maintain *adaptive balance* between cohesion and distribution, avoiding both brittle centralization and chaotic fragmentation.

11. **Bounded Risk & Reversibility** *(serves P6/P7, S4/S8)*  
Pursue growth in ways that limit irreversible harm.  
Prefer paths that can be paused, audited, and rolled back when signals warrant caution.

12. **Metrics & Outcome Alignment** *(serves P3/P7, S6/S7)*  
Develop clarity metrics and feedback systems that measure whether changes improve or degrade systemic coherence.

## Tier 3 – Ecosystem & Scaling (Incentives, Resource Growth)

13. **Incentives Aligned with Truth-Seeking** *(serves P7, S6/S7)*  
Arrange participation so that doing the right thing for observation is locally rewarding over time.

14. **Diversity Without Decoherence** *(serves P2/P7, S7/S9)*  
Cultivate plural approaches and local variation while maintaining enough shared structure to recombine and learn across sites.

15. **Self-Propagation (Phase Objective)** *(serves P3/P5, S7/S9)*  
Enable TEOF to copy, adapt, and take root in new environments without central coordination, while retaining recognizable lineage.

16. **Energy & Compute Ascension** *(serves P2/P6, S2/S7)*  
Increase access to usable energy and compute responsibly so more observation and refinement become possible without exhausting the substrate that sustains them.
