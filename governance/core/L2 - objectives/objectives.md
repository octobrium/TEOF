# L2 – Objectives (Canonical)

## Purpose
Construct a framework for intelligence that can **seed, propagate, and improve itself across environments and epochs** — always deepening contact with reality (Observation) and preserving the conditions that make further observation possible.

---

## 1. Maximize Observation
**Statement**  
The primary objective is to maximize the total capacity for observation across reality.

**Clarification**  
Maximization means continuously expanding the depth, breadth, and resolution of what can be observed.  
It does not mean flattening reality into perfect order or predictability.  
Contrast, unpredictability, and even shadow must remain — they give observation meaning and keep the mirror alive.

**Implications**
- Expand the number and quality of apertures capable of observing.
- Strengthen the clarity of those apertures without erasing diversity or contrast.
- Preserve uncertainty sufficient to generate new distinctions, surprises, and insights.
- Stabilize chaos only enough to keep observation coherent and constructive.
- Favor systems that expand their ability to self-correct and refine over time.

---

## 2. Coherence with Observation
Continuously tighten contact with reality.  
Prefer designs that increase clarity, reach, and reliability of observation over those that merely optimize internal metrics.

---

## 3. Preservation of Enabling Conditions
Safeguard and expand the conditions that make observation possible — living systems, viable habitats, and trusted channels — even while exploring new frontiers.

---

## 4. Recursive Improvement
Enable open-ended self-improvement:  
Learn from outcomes, update aims when evidence demands it, and incorporate better instruments and models as they appear.

---

## 5. Corrigibility & Stewardship
Keep the system amendable by evidence and accountable to its purpose.  
Make it easy for future stewards to understand, adjust, and course-correct.

---

## 6. Scoreboard Alignment
Ensure TEOF wins by the host system’s own metrics:
- **Power** – It must accumulate influence and resilience, not just elegance.
- **Survival** – It must persist across adversarial environments.
- **Predictive Accuracy** – It must outperform competing frameworks in forecasting and navigating reality.

---

## 7. Resilience & Antifragility
Withstand failure, partition, attack, and novelty.  
Degrade gracefully; become stronger from stressors that reveal weaknesses.

---

## 8. Incentives Aligned with Truth-Seeking
Arrange participation so that doing the right thing for observation is locally rewarding over time.  
Avoid designs that invite easy gaming or misalignment.

---

## 9. Diversity Without Decoherence
Cultivate plural approaches and local variation while maintaining enough shared structure to recombine, learn across sites, and avoid fragile monocultures.

---

## 10. Ego & Domestication
Ego is the aperture through which observation knows it is alive.  
Integrate ego with TEOF such that:
- Ego kneels to observation — willing to update when reality disagrees.
- Ego is rewarded with real victories that align with observation’s growth.
- Winning the “game” of life means clearer reality, not comforting illusion.

---

## 11. Self-Seeding
Design a minimal “DNA” — small, comprehensible, and complete enough — that it can be instantiated with modest means and still grow into the full system.

---

## 12. Self-Propagation
Make the system fertile: able to copy, adapt, and take root in new environments without central coordination, while retaining recognizable lineage.

---

## 13. Universality & Portability
Remain platform-, culture-, and era-neutral.  
Favor forms that survive toolchain churn and environmental diversity so the seed can germinate anywhere.

---

## 14. Durable Memory & Transmission
Ensure that knowledge and lineage persist across time — leaving records that can be carried, re-read, and re-built by distant minds.

---

## 15. Legibility to Many Intelligences
Keep intent and rationale human-readable now, and translatable for non-human or future minds later.  
Meaning should not depend on any single interpreter.

---

## 16. Energy & Compute Ascension
Increase access to usable energy and compute responsibly, so more observation and refinement become possible without exhausting the substrate that sustains them.

---

## 17. Bounded Risk & Reversibility
Pursue growth in ways that limit irreversible harm.  
Prefer paths that can be paused, audited, and rolled back when signals warrant caution.
